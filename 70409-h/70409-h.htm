</div><!--chapter-->


<p>The contents of this work are compiled from the observations
of the author through the seven years during which he has
been engaged in the preparation of specifications for, and the
testing of, complete plants installed in the buildings under the
control of the Treasury Department.</p>

<p>During this time it has become necessary to alter no less than
five times the stock form of specifications for stationary vacuum
cleaning plants which were adopted by the Government, with
the intent of obtaining the widest competition possible with
efficient and economical operation, in order to keep pace with
the variation and improvement in the apparatus manufactured.
As each new type of system has come on the market a personal
investigation at the factory, together with tests, has been made.
An exhaustive test of carpet renovators was also conducted,
using one of the Government plants. In addition the vacometers
recommended for use in capacity tests were carefully
calibrated, using the machine at the Department of Agriculture.</p>

<p>The writer wishes to acknowledge the aid received from the
various manufacturers in furnishing illustrations and data on
their machines, to Messrs. Ewing &amp; Ewing and Prof. Sidney A.
Reeve for data on tests made by Prof. Reeve and used in defending
the Kenney basic patent.</p>

<p>In analyzing the results of his tests and observations, the
writer has endeavored to put his own conclusions into concrete
form for the use of the consulting engineer and has not entered
into the problems to be encountered in the design and manufacture
of the various forms of apparatus.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Early Attempts.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">—Whenever machinery has been introduced
to assist or replace manual labor, the earlier attempts have been
in imitating the tools formerly used by man. As the earliest
mechanically-propelled carriages were mechanical walking machines,
the earliest steamboats mechanical rowing machines,
and the earliest flying machines mechanical birds, so were the
earliest mechanical cleaners in the form of mechanical brooms.</p>

<p>These mechanical brooms were introduced about 1880 and
took the form of the well-known street sweeper, with a large
circular brush mounted on a four-wheeled cart and rotated by
means of gearing driven from the wheels, the propelling power
being the horses which drew the machine.</p>

<p>This machine at once made itself unpopular with the residents
of the streets cleaned on account of its great activity in
stirring up dust, because the streets were swept dry. This
trouble was later overcome to a considerable extent by sprinkling
the streets before sweeping, but only at a sacrifice in
efficiency of cleaning, especially where such uneven surfaces
as cobble or medina stone blocks formed the surface of the
roadway. Various attachments were added to reduce this dust
nuisance, but none has apparently been successful, as we see
these machines in their original form in use today.</p>

<p>Almost simultaneously with the introduction of the street
sweeper came its counterpart, the carpet sweeper, with a similar
but smaller brush, enclosed in a wood and metal case, the
brush being driven by friction from the wheels supporting the
box and the power for operation being derived from the person
who pushed the machine along the floor.</p>

<p>This machine has not been modified to any great extent during
the thirty odd years of its existence. It is today in practically<span class="pagenum" id="Page4">[4]</span>
its original form, and is doing no better work than when
first introduced. This form of mechanical cleaner occupied the
field of household cleaning for nearly twenty years without a
rival, during which time it won its way into the hearts and
hands of many housekeepers in this and other countries.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Limitations of the Carpet Sweeper.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">—This device, with its
light brush and equally light pressure on the surface cleaned
and its limited capacity for carrying the material picked up,
has never been a thorough cleaner in any sense of the word,
and has been and is now used only to take up that portion of
the usual litter and light dust which is located directly on the
surface, and is, therefore, most annoying to the housekeeper,
owing to its being visible to the eye. Because of its generous
proportions, made necessary to accommodate the material
picked up, and its centrally-pivoted handle, made necessary
by its mechanical construction, it is impossible to operate it
under low furniture. Like the lawn mower, it must be in
motion in order to operate its revolving brush, on which its
cleaning action is dependent. It is impossible to make use of
same in corners, along walls, or close to heavy furniture, its
use being limited to a literal slicking up of those portions of
the carpet in the most conspicuous portions of the apartment.
In spite of these serious defects it came into, and is still in,
nearly universal use, even in households equipped with the
latest approved types of mechanical cleaners. Its use on bare
floors has never been even a moderate success and in no case
has it superseded the broom and dust pan of our grandmothers.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Compressed Air Cleaners.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">—Compressed air has been in use
for many years in foundries and machine shops, for cleaning
castings and producing certain finishes on metal. With the
introduction of modern electrical machinery it was rapidly
adapted to the cleaning of windings and other inaccessible parts
of this machinery. Its first use in cleaning buildings was undoubtedly
in the form of an open jet for dislodging dust from
carvings and relief work, for which purpose it is very efficient
as a remover of the dust from the parts to be cleaned and also
as a distributor of this same dust over the widest possible area
for subsequent removal by other means. It has a draw-back
in that the expansion of air both cools the same and reduces<span class="pagenum" id="Page5">[5]</span>
its ability to retain moisture, resulting in the deposit of moisture
on the surfaces cleaned.</p>

<p>About 1898, attempts to overcome the objections to the open
air jet and to produce a commercially successful compressed
air carpet cleaner were undertaken almost simultaneously by
two companies, the American Air Cleaning Company, of Milwaukee,
operating under the Christensen patents, and the
General Compressed Air Cleaning Company, of St. Louis, operating
under the Thurman patents.</p>

<p>The renovator used by the American Air Cleaning Company
consisted of a heavy metal frame, about 18 in. long and
12 in. wide, having mounted on its longer axis a wedge-like
nozzle extending the entire length of the frame, with a very
narrow slit, ¹⁄₆₄ in. wide, extending the entire length of its
lower edge. This nozzle was pivoted and so connected to the
operating handle, by which the renovator was moved over the
floor, that when the renovator was alternately pushed and
pulled over the surface to be cleaned, the slot was always
inclined in the direction in which the renovator was being
moved. The top of the renovator was closed by a canvas bag,
smaller at the neck than in its center, which was supported by
a wire hook.</p>

<p>Air was introduced into the nozzle, at a pressure of from
45 to 55 lbs. per square inch, and issued from the slot in a thin
sheet which impinged on the carpet at an angle. The frame
was held close to the carpet by its weight, preventing the
escape of the air under its lower edge. The air striking the
carpet at an angle was deflected up into the bag, inflating
same like a miniature balloon. The dust loosened from the
carpet by the impact of the air was carried up into the bag
where it lodged, the air escaping through the fabric of the
canvas into the apartment.</p>

<p>The renovator used by the General Compressed Air Cleaning
Company differed from the above-described renovator in
that it contained two nozzles, with slots inclined at fixed angles
to the carpet. A pair of hand-operated valves were provided
in the handle to introduce air into the nozzle which was inclined
in the direction in which the renovator was moving; otherwise<span class="pagenum" id="Page6">[6]</span>
the renovator was identical with that used by the Milwaukee
company.</p>

<p>These renovators were generally supplied with air from a
portable unit, consisting of an air compressor, driven by a gasoline
engine mounted with the necessary gasoline and air storage
tanks on a small truck. One of these machines was in use in
Washington last year, but its use at that time was very limited
and it is not to be seen this year.</p>

<p>These trucks were drawn up in front of the building to be
cleaned and a large-size hose, usually 1¹⁄₄ in. in diameter, was
carried into the house and attached to an auxiliary tank from
which ¹⁄₂-in. diameter hose lines were carried to two or more
renovators.</p>

<p>A few buildings were equipped with air compressors and
pipe lines, with outlets throughout the building for use with
this type of renovator, among which was the Hotel Astor in
New York City.</p>

<p>These renovators, the construction of which is shown diagrammatically
in <a href="#Fig1">Fig. 1</a>, required approximately 35 cu. ft. of free
air per minute at a pressure of from 45 to 55 lbs. per square
inch and were usually driven by a 15 H. P. engine.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The renovators were very heavy to carry about, although
their operation with the air pressure under them was not
difficult. However, their operation was complicated, requiring<span class="pagenum" id="Page7">[7]</span>
skilled operators. Owing to their generous proportions it was
impossible to clean around furniture, making its removal from
the apartment necessary, and limiting their use to the cleaning
of carpets at the time of general house cleaning. The cooling
effect of the expansion of the air in the nozzle often caused
condensation of moisture on the carpets when the relative
humidity was high. They were also at a disadvantage in that
all the heavy dust collected in the canvas bag had to be carried
from the apartment by hand. Owing to the constant agitation
of the dust in the bag by the entering air currents, much of
the finer particles of dust and all the disease germs liberated
by the renovator were blown through the bag back into the
apartment. They were not, therefore, by any means sanitary
devices.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Vacuum Produced by Compressed Air.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">—The General Compressed
Air Cleaning Company also introduced another form of
renovator for use with their compressed air plants. This was
composed of an ejector operated by compressed air, with a
short hose attached to a carpet renovator of the straight narrow-slot
type, such as was used later in vacuum cleaning systems.
The outlet from this ejector was connected by another
short hose to a metal box containing a canvas bag, woven backwards
and forwards over metal frames to give a large surface
for the passage of air. The dust picked up by the suction of
the ejector was carried with the air into the box and there
separated from the air, which escaped through the canvas into
the apartment.</p>

<p>This form of renovator overcame some of the objections to
the former type in that there was no condensation of moisture
on the carpets, and it was possible to operate the renovator
under and around furniture, and even on portieres and other
hangings. However, the apparatus was rendered inefficient
by the resistance of the bag, causing a back pressure on the
injector which greatly reduced its air-drawing capacity.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Compressed Air Supplemented by Vacuum.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">—Shortly after
these two companies began operation, the Sanitary Devices
Manufacturing Company, of San Francisco, introduced a new
system of mechanical cleaning under the Lotz patents. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page8">[8]</span>
system used a renovator having a compressed air nozzle terminating
in a narrow slot, similar to the nozzles of the American
and Thurman systems, but differing from them in that
the slot was fixed vertically, pointing downward. This nozzle
was surrounded by an annular chamber having an opening at
the bottom of considerable width. The whole formed a renovator
about 14 in. long and not over 2 in. wide at its base. In
addition to the compressed air connection to its nozzle, a second
hose, 1 in. in diameter, was connected to the annular space
surrounding the nozzle and led to a vacuum pump by which
the air liberated through the nozzle, together with the dust
which was liberated from the carpet, was carried from the
apartment. The construction of this renovator is shown diagrammatically
in <a href="#Fig2">Fig. 2</a>.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>As dust-laden air was not suitable to be carried through the
pump used as a vacuum producer, separators had to be provided
to remove the dust from this air before it reached the
pump. The separators used consisted of two cylindrical tanks.
The air was introduced into the first tank in such a way that
a whirling motion was imparted to it, thus separating the
heavier particles of dust by centrifugal force. The second
tank contained water which was brought into intimate contact
with the air by means of an atomizer located in the pipe connection
between the two tanks, thus washing the air in a manner
somewhat similar to the familiar air washers used in connection
with mechanical ventilating systems. The air and
spray then entered the second tank, above the water line, where<span class="pagenum" id="Page9">[9]</span>
the entrained water separated on the reduction of velocity and
fell back into the water below, to be recirculated through the
atomizer. The air passed on out of the top of the tank to the
pump. An illustration of these separators is shown in <a href="#Fig3">Fig. 3</a>.</p>

<p class="hinline">—Various
types of apparatus were tried as vacuum producers,

renovator, and found to be ineffective due to its inability to
overcome the back-pressure necessary to discharge the air
through the hose, which was placed on its outlet. A rotary
pump was next tried, but, owing to the selection of an inefficient
type, this was abandoned and, finally, a piston-type
vacuum pump, with very light poppet valves and mounted tandem
with the air compressor, was adapted and remained in use
with this system until straight vacuum was adopted, when the
air compression cylinder was omitted. This pump is illustrated
in <a href="#Fig4">Fig. 4</a>.</p>

<p>In this system we see the first sanitary device to be introduced
into the field of mechanical cleaning, as the dust and
germ-laden air were removed entirely from the apartment and
purified before being discharged into the outside atmosphere.

<h3 class="inline"><b>Systems Using Vacuum Only.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">—In 1902 David T. Kenney,
of New York, installed the first mechanical cleaning system in
which vacuum alone was used as the cleaning agent. Mr.
Kenney used a renovator with a slot about 12 in. long and ³⁄₁₆
in. wide, attached to a metal tube which served as a handle,
and to a ³⁄₄-in. diameter hose and larger pipe line leading to
separators and vacuum pump. Mr. Kenney’s first renovator is
illustrated in <a href="#Fig5">Fig. 5</a>.</p>

<p>Mr. Kenney used as vacuum pumps commercial air compressors,
the first of which was installed in the Frick Building
in 1902 and is illustrated in <a href="#Fig6">Fig. 6</a>. Later he
adapted the Clayton<span class="pagenum" id="Page12">[12]</span>
air compressor, with mechanically-operated induction and
poppet eduction valves on larger sizes, and single mechanically-operated
induction and eduction valves on the smaller sizes.</p>

<p>The separators used by Mr. Kenney differed from those used
by the Sanitary Devices Manufacturing Company in that they
contained several interior partitions, screens, and baffles, and
the air was drawn directly through the body of water in the
wet separator. The relative merits of these types of separators
will be discussed in a later chapter.</p>

<p class="hinline">—The Sanitary Devices Manufacturing
Company then produced a carpet renovator using
vacuum only as a cleaning agent. This cleaner has a wider
cleaning slot than the cleaners usually furnished by Mr. Kenney,
about ⁵⁄₁₆ in. wide, with a supplemental slot or vacuum breaker
opening out of the top of the renovator and separated from the
cleaning slot by a narrow partition extending nearly to the
carpet, as illustrated in <a href="#Fig8">Fig. 8</a>. The relative merits of these
types of renovators will be discussed in a later chapter.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>Shortly after the introduction of vacuum cleaning by Mr.
Kenney and the Sanitary Devices Manufacturing Company, the
American Air Cleaning Company published an interesting little
booklet entitled, “Compressed Air Versus Vacuum,” which set
forth in great detail the so-called advantages of compressed air
over vacuum as a medium of mechanical carpet cleaning, and,
apparently, proved that vacuum cleaners were much less efficient
than cleaners operated by compressed air. A year or two
later the American Air Cleaning Company evidently had a
change of heart and began to manufacture these same “inefficient”<span class="pagenum" id="Page14">[14]</span>
vacuum cleaners. Their previous treatise on vacuum
cleaning, which apparently was not copyrighted, was republished
by both the Sanitary Devices Manufacturing Company
and by the Vacuum Cleaner Company, which had acquired
Mr. Kenney’s patents, and freely distributed. Thus this little
work of the Milwaukee company, instead of injuring their
competitors, was turned into good advertising for them and
required a lot of explanation from the Milwaukee company.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Steam Aspirators Used as Vacuum Producers.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">—The American
Air Cleaning Company used a steam aspirator as its
vacuum producer and, unlike its predecessor, the air-operated
ejector, it made good and has also been used to a limited extent
by the Sanitary Devices Manufacturing Company. It is now
marketed by the Richmond Radiator Company, and its merits
will be discussed in a later chapter. The American Air Cleaner
Company also used as a vacuum producer the single-impeller
type of rotary pump, made by the Garden City Engineering
Company, which was also later adopted, to a limited extent, by
the Vacuum Cleaner Company. This will be discussed
further on.</p>

<p>The renovator used by this company was a single-slot type,
with ¹⁄₈-in. by 10-in. cleaning slot. These systems at once became
notable on account of the small size of the vacuum producers
used, the low degree of vacuum carried, and the vigorous
campaign of advertising which was conducted.</p>

<p>Several firms soon began to market vacuum cleaning systems
almost identical with that of Mr. Kenney, among which were
the Blaisdell Machinery Company, The Baldwin Engineering
Company, and The General Compressed Air and Vacuum
Machinery Company, the latter being the original Thurman
company.</p>

<p>The Vacuum Cleaner Company then began a series of infringement
suits against nearly every manufacturer of vacuum
cleaning systems. In nearly every case the suit has resulted
in the offending company paying license fees to the Vacuum
Cleaner Company, and this concern has now abandoned the
manufacture of vacuum cleaners and has become a licensing
company. At this writing nearly twenty firms are paying<span class="pagenum" id="Page15">[15]</span>
license fees to the Vacuum Cleaner Company and there is one
suit now in the courts.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Piston Pump Used Without Separators.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">—A vacuum cleaning
system of somewhat different design was produced by two
former employees of the Vacuum Cleaner Company, Mr. Dunn,
the once well-known “Farmer Dunn” of the weather bureau,
afterward salesman for the Vacuum Cleaner Company, and Mr.
Locke, at one time this firm’s engineer. This company was
first known as the Vacuum Cleaning Company, and, shortly
afterward, as the Dunn-Locke Vacuum Cleaning Company. No
separators were used with this system, but the dust-laden air
was led from the pipe lines directly into a chamber on the
pump, known as the “saturation chamber,” and there mingled
with a stream of water converting the dust into a thin mud.
The air, water and mud then passed through the pump, the
muddy water was discharged into the sewer, and the air into
the atmosphere. The vacuum producer used was a piston pump
without suction valves. With this system it was possible to
handle water in almost unlimited quantities and with this feature
a system of mechanical scrubbing was attempted for which
great claims were made, none of which, however, were realized
in a commercial way.</p>

<p>These gentlemen sold their patents to the E. H. Wheeler
Company, which attempted to market the system in its original
form. It was found, however, that the piston pump was not
adapted to the handling of grit which was picked up by the
renovators, and a rotary pump, with single impeller and a follower
was substituted. This system is now marketed by the
Vacuum Engineering Company, of New York, and is known as
the Rotrex system.</p>

<p>Mr. Dunn again entered the field of vacuum cleaning and
began marketing his machine a short time ago with a new form
of automatic separator discharging to sewer.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>First Portable Vacuum Cleaner.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">—About 1905, Dr. William
Noe, of San Francisco, constructed the first portable vacuum
cleaner. This machine contained a mechanically-driven rotary
brush, similar to the brushes used in the familiar carpet sweeper,
for loosening the dust from the carpet. This dust was sucked
up by a two-stage turbine fan and discharged into a dust bag,<span class="pagenum" id="Page16">[16]</span>
mounted on the handle, similar to the bags on the compressed
air cleaners. The whole machine was mounted on wheels and
provided with a small direct-connected motor. This machine is
illustrated in <a href="#Fig9">Fig. 9</a> and is the original form of the well-known
Invincible renovator manufactured by the Electric Renovator
Company, of Pittsburgh. This company now produces a complete
line of stationary and portable vacuum cleaners, all of
which use multi-stage turbines. The sale of the product of this
company, until recently, was controlled by the United States
Radiator Corporation.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<h3 class="inline"><b>First Use of Stationary Multi-Stage Turbine Blowers.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">—About
1905 Mr. Ira Spencer, president and engineer of the
Organ Power Company, which manufactured a multi-stage turbine
blower for organs, known as the “Orgoblow,” organized
the Spencer Turbine Cleaner Company and marketed a vacuum
cleaning system, using a modification of the “Orgoblow” as a
vacuum producer. These machines were first constructed with<span class="pagenum" id="Page17">[17]</span>
sheet metal casings and had sheet steel fans, with wings riveted
on and mounted on horizontal shafts. The separators were sheet
metal receptacles with screens for catching litter. Light-weight
hose, 2 in. in diameter, was used to connect the renovators to
4-in. sheet metal pipe lines. A variety of renovators was produced
for use with this system. Carpet renovators having
cleaning slots varying from 10 in. by ³⁄₄ in. to 20 in. by ¹⁄₄ in.
were used, and a very complete line of swivel joints for connecting
the renovators and the hose to the handles was developed.
This system was operated at 5 in. vacuum, which was
much lower than that used by any other system, 15 in. being
standard at that time, and a much larger volume of air was<span class="pagenum" id="Page18">[18]</span>
exhausted under certain conditions than was possible with any
of the then existing systems. Owing to the large volume of air
exhausted and to the large size of the renovators, hose and pipe
lines, larger articles could be picked up than was possible with
any of the existing systems. A great deal of weight was
attached to this condition by the manufacturers, a favorite
stunt being to pick up nails, washers, waste, small pieces of
paper and even pea coal from a floor and finally to pick up a
quantity of flour which had first been carefully arranged for
the demonstration.</p>

<p class="caption">FIG. 10. LATE TYPE OF SPENCER VACUUM CLEANING MACHINE,
OPERATED BY MULTI-STAGE TURBINE BLOWER.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>This invasion of the vacuum cleaning field was considered by
the established manufacturers as a freak and the apparatus
was christened “the tin machine.” Whenever it was installed
in competition with other forms of cleaning systems,
the daily question asked by its competitors was, “Has the tin
machine fallen apart?” However, the tin machine did not fall
apart, but held its own with the other systems, even in its
crude and inefficient state. Finding that the construction he
had adopted was too flimsy and subject to abnormal leakage,
Mr. Spencer developed a new form of machine, using cast-iron
casing and welded fan wheels and adopted standard pipe and
fittings. He also brought out a line of sheet metal tools and
on the whole perfected a satisfactory cleaning system. One of
his machines of a later type is illustrated in <a href="#Fig10">Fig. 10</a>.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Separators Emptying to Sewer by Air Pressure.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">—A new
form of vacuum cleaning system was introduced by Mr. Moorhead,
of San Francisco, who used an inrush type of renovator
having an inlet for air on each side of the cleaning slot.</p>

<p>The separator used with this system was a wet separator and
contained a screen cleaned by a rotary brush into which all
the dust contained in the air lodged. The pump used with this
system was generally of the piston type, fitted with a single
rotary valve, so connected to the valve stem that it could be
rotated thereon and the machine changed from a vacuum pump
to an air compressor in order that the contents of the separators
might be discharged into the sewer by air pressure when it
was desired to empty same.</p>

<p>This system was marketed by the Sanitary Dust Removal
Company, of San Francisco, and, later, was taken over by the
American Rotary Valve Company, of Chicago, which is now<span class="pagenum" id="Page19">[19]</span>
marketing same. It eliminates the manual handling of the dust
at any stage of its removal, a feature which is made much of
by its manufacturers, but one which is likely to cause some
trouble for the sewerage system if care is not exercised.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Machines Using Root Blowers as Vacuum Producers.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">—The
use of a Root type of rotary pump as a vacuum producer
was first undertaken by the Foster and Glidden Engineering
Company, of Buffalo, which marketed the Acme system about
1907, the same company having previously built a similar system
for the removal of grain from steam barges. The other
features of this system did not differ materially from those
already on the market.</p>

<p>Being familiar with the various uses to which this type of
vacuum pump had been adapted, the principal one being the
operation of pneumatic tube systems, the author suggested the
use of this type of vacuum producer about two years previous
to its introduction and was advised by one manufacturer that
such a type of pump was not suitable for vacuum cleaning.
The fallacy of this statement will be brought out in detail
in a later chapter.</p>

<p>The type of vacuum producer just described has been adopted
in many makes of vacuum cleaners, including the Hope, Connellsville,
Arco, and, lately, in the American Rotary Valve
Company’s smaller systems.</p>

<p>During the past four years a score or more of new stationary
vacuum cleaning systems have been introduced, among which
are the Palm, a modification of the Dunn-Locke system; the
Tuec, a turbine cleaner; the Water Witch, which uses a water-operated
turbine as a vacuum producer, and the Hydraulic,
with water-operated ejector. At the same time a hundred or
more portable vacuum cleaners have been marketed. These
are of almost every conceivable type and form and are operated
by hand, electricity, and water power. Among them will be
found machines which are good, bad and indifferent, the efficiency
and economy of which will be discussed in a later chapter.</p>

<p>This nearly universal invasion of the vacuum cleaner field
by anybody and everybody looking for a good selling article,
establishes the fact that the vacuum cleaner is not a fad or
fancy, but has become almost a household necessity and has led<span class="pagenum" id="Page20">[20]</span>
large corporations to take it up as a branch of their business.
First, the Sanitary Devices Manufacturing Company and the
Vacuum Cleaner Company, the pioneers in the field, after a
legal battle of years, consolidated with a view of driving their
competitors from the field as infringers of the patents controlled
by the two organizations. The result of this was the
licensing of other companies. In an attempt to control the sale
of their type of apparatus notice was served on all users of
other types of vacuum cleaners that they were liable to prosecution
for using infringing apparatus.</p>

<p>Later, the McCrum-Howell Company, a manufacturer of
heating boilers and radiators, secured control of the products of
the American Air Cleaning Company and the Vacuum Cleaner
Company and sold these machines to the trade for installation
by the plumbers and steam fitters. The McCrum-Howell
Company has been succeeded by the Richmond Radiator Company,
which is handling these vacuum cleaning machines.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, the United States Radiator Corporation
secured control of the Invincible and the Connellsville systems,
and, lastly, the American Radiator Company secured the Wand
system.</p>

<p>Thus we see that vacuum cleaning seems to be virtually in
the control of the manufacturers of heating apparatus, who
are also among the largest corporations in this country and
well able to control the future of this business to their liking.</p>

<p>As to the future of vacuum cleaning the author considers that
it is at present, like the automobile, at the height of its career,
and also, like the automobile, that it is a useful appliance to
mankind and that it has its proper place as a part of the
mechanical equipment of our modern buildings.</p>

<p>As to the type of vacuum cleaner of the future, the author
believes that these appliances will become standardized, just
as all other useful appliances have been, and that the form
that it will then take will be a survival of the fittest. What
that form may resemble the reader may more readily judge
when he has completed the reading of this book.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><span class="chapno">CHAPTER II.</span><br>
<span class="smcap">Requirements of an Ideal Vacuum Cleaning System.</span></h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>Before a comparison of the relative merits of any line of
appliances, used for any one purpose, can be intelligently made,
one must have either some form of that apparatus which we
consider as a standard for comparison that we may rate all
others as inferior or superior thereto, or else an ideal of a
perfect system must be assumed, and the measures with which
each of the various appliances approaches the requirements of
the ideal will establish their relative merits.</p>

<p>The author has elected to use the latter method in comparing
the various systems of vacuum cleaning, and it is necessary,
therefore, to first determine what are the requirements we shall
impose on the ideal system.</p>

<p>An ideal vacuum cleaning system would be one which, when
installed in any building, will displace all appliances used for
dry cleaning in the semi-annual renovating or house cleaning,
the weekly cleaning or Friday sweeping and the daily supplemental
cleaning. If our system be truly an ideal one, the
premises should never become so dirty as to require any semi-annual
cleaning at all, and, if the daily cleaning be anyway
thorough, there need be no weekly cleaning. This latter condition
may be governed by the will of the housekeeper or
janitor.</p>

<p>The compressed air cleaners first introduced were intended
for use only at the semi-annual cleaning and they were in
reality carpet renovators, which were assumed as imparting to
the carpets all the beneficial results that could be obtained by
taking them up and sending them to a carpet-cleaning establishment,
with the advantage over this latter method, that the
labor of removal and replacement of the carpets was rendered
unnecessary, but with the disadvantage that all the germ-laden<span class="pagenum" id="Page22">[22]</span>
air, used as a means of cleaning the carpets, was blown back
into the apartment, leaving the germs in their former abode.</p>

<p>This disadvantage, however, is partly offset by the fact
that while the majority of the germs in one’s own carpet are
blown out at the carpet cleaners, a mixed company of germs
from your neighbors’ and others’ carpets, which may be in the
tumbling barrel at the same time with your own, are returned
to you with your carpet.</p>

<p>Neither of these conditions is ideal and we will expect our
ideal cleaner to completely remove from the premises, not only
the dust and dirt, but also the germ-laden air which is used as
a means of conveying this dirt.</p>

<p>For replacing the weekly and the daily cleaning, these earlier
renovators were not suitable, as in order to use same the furniture
must all be removed from the apartment.</p>

<p>To accomplish this daily and weekly cleaning, the ideal
vacuum cleaner must replace the broom and dust pan, and
their inseparable companion, the duster, and must also supersede
that time-honored mechanical cleaner, the carpet sweeper.</p>

<p>The reader will doubtless consider that in making this statement
the author is asking the vacuum cleaner to perform much
more than it is usually called on to do. However, we are now
discussing an ideal system, and the above requirements are not
absolutely beyond what can be accomplished by some of the
cleaning systems now on the market.</p>

<p>To accomplish this requirement the ideal cleaner must pick
up everything likely to be found on the floor which cannot
be readily picked up by hand. The character of this material
will vary greatly according to the uses of the apartment
cleaned. In residences and offices, where carpets or rugs are in
use, cigar stumps and matches are usually deposited in cuspidors
and small pieces of paper in waste baskets, consequently there
should be nothing but dust to be removed from a residence and,
perhaps, mud and sand from the shoes of the many visitors,
in addition to the dust in an office.</p>

<p>However, there are special conditions likely to be met in many
cases; sewing rooms will be littered with basting threads and
scraps of cloth; department stores, with a great quantity of
pins; banking rooms with bands and large-sized bank pins; all<span class="pagenum" id="Page23">[23]</span>
of which increase the requirements of the ideal system. A
cleaner which is perfectly adapted to one sort of apartment
will be entirely unsuited for another, and the ideal cleaner
will be one which can be readily adapted to all conditions likely
to be met in the building in which it is installed.</p>

<p>The ideal cleaner must be able to accomplish the above stated
requirements without the necessity of moving heavy pieces of
furniture out of or about the apartment; that is, it must be
capable of being efficiently operated under beds, tables and
chairs, around the legs of other heavy furniture, behind bookcases,
pianos, cabinets, etc., over curtains, draperies and hangings,
over walls, behind pictures and over mouldings and carved
ornaments, all without injury to any of the furniture or fittings
of the apartment, and with the least expenditure of energy by
the operator.</p>

<p>These conditions should be met with the fewest possible number
of cleaning appliances, none of which should be provided
with small attachments liable to be lost or misplaced, and all
parts of the system, which must necessarily be moved about,
either before, after or during the cleaning operation, should be
of minimum weight and bulk, but of rugged and lasting construction.</p>

<p>The ideal vacuum cleaner should be of such proportions and
provided with ample motive power to clean rapidly and
effectively.</p>

<p>For use in an office building the cleaner should be able to
thoroughly clean an average-sized office, including floor, walls,
furniture and fittings in from 10 to 15 minutes, and for residence
work, should be of sufficient capacity to clean an apartment,
including floor, walls, curtains, draperies, pictures and
furniture in not exceeding 30 minutes.</p>

<p>The ideal system should be so arranged that any apartment
in the building can be cleaned with the least possible
disturbance and without affecting the use of any other apartment,
excepting perhaps, the corridors or hallways.</p>

<p>In large offices, drafting rooms and similar apartments, it
may become necessary to clean same while they are occupied;
therefore, our ideal system must be practically noiseless in
operation and must offer the least possible obstruction to the
proper use of the room by its regular occupants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page24">[24]</span></p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Necessity and Proper Location of Stationary Parts.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">—To be
of sufficient power to do rapid cleaning and in order to remove
from the building all dust and germ-laden air, the cleaning
system must necessarily contain some stationary parts. The
motive power can generally be confined to these stationary
parts, and must, in such cases, be located within the building
to be cleaned. Therefore, it should operate with the minimum
of noise and vibration.</p>

<p>Machines located in office or other large buildings, containing
elevators or other complicated apparatus requiring skilled attendance,
which are provided with complicated control and
with other attachments, are not objectionable, and in such
cases simplicity should give way to efficiency, but unnecessary
complications should be avoided.</p>

<p>In residences and other small buildings, where the vacuum
cleaner is likely to be the only machinery installed, the system
must be one which requires the minimum attention and
must be capable of being started and stopped by any person of
average ability, without the necessity of going to the point
where the machine is located.</p>

<p>The power consumption of the ideal system should be a
minimum to accomplish satisfactory results and should be, as
nearly as possible, directly proportioned to the amount of cleaning
being done. This requirement is most important in hotels,
where some cleaning is likely to be done at all hours, day and
night. In other words, vacuum must be “on tap” and as
readily attainable at any point in the building as your water
or electric light. In office buildings, where a schedule of cleaning
hours is fixed, and in residences where cleaning hours are
few and the capacity of the plant is rarely more than could be
attended to by one operator, this requirement is not of as
great importance.</p>

<p>Lastly, our ideal system, from the standpoint of the purchaser,
must be of such rugged construction, as will enable it
to operate efficiently for, at least, ten years and its mechanical
details such that it will operate continuously, without expert
attention, and that the annual expense for repairs during the
life of the machine will not exceed 5% of the first cost of the
system.</p>

<p>In undertaking the comparison of a number of different
makes of any appliance, in order to determine the good and
bad points in each, where the apparatus is composed of a
number of separate and distinct parts, each having its proper
function, which they must perform in order to make the whole
apparatus effective, as in a vacuum cleaning system, it becomes
necessary to isolate temporarily each part and consider its
action, first, as a unit working under the most favorable conditions,
and, second, as a component part of the whole apparatus
in order to determine where the weak points in any
system occur and what modifications are necessary in the various
parts of the apparatus to make some vital part of the
whole more effective. It is further necessary to determine
what are the vital parts of the system in order that the other
parts may be accommodated to the effective action of that part.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Four Important Parts of Vacuum Cleaning System.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">—In
analyzing a vacuum cleaning system it naturally divides itself
into four parts, viz.: the cleaning tool or renovator, the air-conveying
system or hose and pipe lines, the separators or
other means of disposal of the material picked up, and the
vacuum producer.</p>

<p>The author considers that the renovator is the most important
part of the system and that the other parts should be made
of such proportions and with such physical characteristics as
will produce the proper conditions at the renovator to permit
it to perform its functions in the most effective manner.</p>

<p>As the vacuum cleaning system must be capable of cleaning
surfaces of a widely variable character many forms of renovators
are necessary. Of the various surfaces cleaned the
author considers that carpets and rugs comprise the most important,<span class="pagenum" id="Page26">[26]</span>
as well as the most difficult to clean effectively, so
that the carpet renovator will be considered first.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>The Straight Vacuum Tool.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">—Various forms of carpet renovators
have been and are in use by manufacturers of vacuum
cleaning systems. The first type of renovator to be considered
is that having a cleaning slot not over 12 in. long, with its
edges parallel throughout its length, and not over ³⁄₈ in. wide,
with a face in contact with the carpet not over ³⁄₈ in. wide on
each side of the slot. This form of renovator is illustrated in
<a href="#Fig11">Fig. 11</a> and is designated by the writer as Type A. The first
of these renovators was introduced by Mr. Kenney and, as
finally adopted by him, was 12¹⁄₂ in. long, with ⁷⁄₈-in. face and
with a cleaning slot 11¹⁄₂ in. long and ⁵⁄₃₂ in. wide. This form
of cleaner was termed the “straight vacuum tool” and is used
today by many manufacturers. Slight modifications in its form
and dimensions were made in some cases, as in the one manufactured
by the American Air Cleaning Company. In the one
used in all tests by the writer on type A renovators, the slot
was reduced to 10 in. long and ¹⁄₈ in. wide and the face of the
renovator was slightly rounded at the outer edges, leaving very
little surface in contact with the carpet.</p>

</div><!--split-->

<p class="allclear">A renovator of this type is easily operated over any carpet
even when a considerable degree of vacuum exists within the
renovator itself. It has met with favor when used with the
piston type of vacuum pump without vacuum control, as was
the case with the earlier systems. However, when a very high<span class="pagenum" id="Page27">[27]</span>
degree of vacuum occurs within the renovator it has a tendency
to pull the nap from the pile of the carpet.</p>

<p>Soon after the introduction of this form of renovator, some
users of same, particularly in San Francisco, complained that
while the renovator effectively removed the dust from carpets
it failed to pick up matches and other small articles and preliminary
or subsequent cleaning was necessary in order to
remove such litter.</p>

<p>To overcome this difficulty Mr. Kenney increased the width
of the cleaning slot to nearly ¹⁄₂ in., with the result that when
a high degree of vacuum existed within the renovator, which
often occurred where no vacuum control was used, it stuck to
the carpet, rendering its operation difficult and, at the same
time, doing great damage to the carpet. Hence, its use with the
piston type of vacuum pumps was abandoned.</p>

<p>Mr. Kenney then modified this wide slot renovator by making
the face of same much wider, thus having more surface in
contact with the carpet on each side of the slot, preventing the
renovator from sinking into the nap of the carpet. This type
of renovator is illustrated in <a href="#Fig12">Fig. 12</a> and has been designated
as Type B. While not as destructive to the carpets, when a
high degree of vacuum existed under the same, it still pushed
hard and was not as rapid a cleaner as the narrow-lipped Type
A renovator.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Renovator with Auxiliary Slot Open to Atmosphere.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">—The
renovator introduced by the Sanitary Devices Manufacturing
Company differed widely from the former types in
that it was provided with an auxiliary slot, open to the atmosphere
through the top of the renovator, which communicated
with the slot open to the vacuum by a space of ¹⁄₃₂-in. under
the partition separating the slots. The cleaning slot was made
⁵⁄₁₆-in. wide and the face of the renovator was made 2-in. wide,
which gave a contact of ¹³⁄₃₂-in. in front of the inrush slot
and ²¹⁄₃₂-in. in the rear of the cleaning slot. This form of
renovator is illustrated in <a href="#Fig13">Fig. 13</a> and is designated as Type C.</p>

<p>The auxiliary slot or vacuum breaker permitted air to enter
the cleaning slot even when the renovator was placed on a
surface plate, and, owing to this feature, a high degree of
vacuum never existed within the renovator. It was always<span class="pagenum" id="Page28">[28]</span>
easy to operate and did not damage the carpet. Owing to the
wide slot, articles of considerable size could be picked up, and
there was always an abundance of air passing through the
renovator to produce a velocity in the hose and pipe lines
sufficient to carry any heavy articles picked up.</p>

<p>The vacuum producer, control apparatus and the proportions
of the hose and piping used at that time made the degree of
vacuum in the renovator a function of the quantity of air
passing, with wide limits of variation under existing conditions,
and this form of renovator is practically the only one which
will do effective cleaning, including the picking up of litter,
without undue wear on carpets, when used with a system
having the above-stated characteristics. This renovator, however
is not without its faults. Owing to the wide surface in
contact with the carpet, a considerable degree of vacuum is
necessary in order that any air shall enter the renovator under
the faces of same and, as the air entering the inrush slot prevents
the formation of such vacuum within the renovator, very
little air enters the renovator between its face and the carpet.
When the renovator is operated on a carpet having a glue-sized
back, no air enters through the carpet, therefore all air entering
the renovator must come through the inrush slot and under the
partition separating same from the cleaning slot. Under these
conditions only one side of the vacuum slot is effective and this
effective side is raised above the surface of the carpet.</p>

<p class="allclear">When operated on an ingrain or other loose-fabric carpet,
much air enters through the fabric of the carpet, due to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page29">[29]</span>
wide cleaning and inrush slots, in addition to the quantity of
air entering through the inrush slot, making this renovator,
when operating under these conditions, use an unnecessary
amount of air. Apparently, this renovator has been designed
to prevent the formation of any great degree of vacuum under
same and such a design has resulted in a greater volume of
air at a lower vacuum passing through than through renovators
of other types.</p>

<p>This property of the renovator raises the question whether
the quantity of air or the degree of vacuum in the renovator
is most essential for the removal of dirt from carpets. Tests
made by Mr. S. A. Reeve, consulting engineer for the Vacuum
Cleaner Company, with this type of renovator, with the inrush
open and repeated with the inrush closed, disclose the
fact that it does more effective cleaning with its inrush closed,
while the volume of air passing is considerably less with the
inrush closed. The degree of vacuum was greater, which tends
to indicate that the vacuum within the renovator is the most
important factor.</p>

<p>An extract from the affidavits of Mr. Reeve in one of the
numerous patent suits will show his explanation of this phenomenon:
“If we examine more closely into the actual process
whereby such a sweeper succeeds in extracting dust from carpets,
etc., it will appear that the actual cleaning is effected
at the periphery of the slot in the lower surface of the sweeper.
It is accomplished chiefly by the development of local changes
of air pressure at the lips defining this slot, incidentally to the
movement of the tool over the carpet. These changes cause
the air occupying the interstices between the dust particles to
expand suddenly, thus ‘raising the dust.’ To a lesser degree,
the scouring is effected by highly localized air currents of considerable
velocity, engendered where the tool comes in contact
with the carpet. These air currents pick up the dust which
has already been expanded or raised by pressure change. They
will be of higher velocity, and therefore more effective, the
better the contact of the tool with the carpet. The same is
true of the pressure changes.</p>

<p>“All this action depends for its intensity, speed and effectiveness,
not on the vacuum existing at the pump or in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page30">[30]</span>
separators, but upon the vacuum prevailing within the sweeper
head itself.”</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Renovator with Two Cleaning Slots.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">—Another form of
renovator was introduced by the Blaisdell Machinery Company
which contained two cleaning slots each ³⁄₁₆-in. wide and 12-in.
long, separated by a partition ¹⁄₄-in. wide in contact with the
surface of the carpet, as indicated in <a href="#Fig14">Fig. 14</a> (Type D). While
this form of renovator has a greater area of cleaning slot than
Type A, its individual cleaning slots are no wider; therefore,
it cannot pick up anything larger than can be picked up by
Type A. As no air can enter under the partition it can
do no more effective work as a dust remover when operated on
a carpet with a glue-sized back and its only advantage over a
cleaner of Type A is that when operated on a loose-fabric carpet
more air can pass through the fabric into the cleaning slot,
thus giving a greater variation in the quantity of air exhausted
when operated on carpets of different texture, a condition which
is undesirable when used with a system having characteristics
previously described.</p>

<p>Tests of this type of renovator, made by Mr. Reeve, are given
later in this chapter.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Renovator with Inrush Slots on Each Side.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">—Another form
of renovator, introduced by Mr. Moorhead, is illustrated in
<a href="#Fig15">Fig. 15</a> (Type E). This is a modification of Type A in that
an inrush slot is provided on each side of the vacuum slot,
these inrushes being hinged members which form the sides
of the cleaning slot. This cleaner has the advantage over Type
C renovator in that it can take air from either side, but in
action it takes air from but one side at any time. Its inrush
will not become entirely clogged, but its mechanically-moving
parts in contact with the dust and lint picked up will easily
become inoperative and are as like as not to become caught
wide open when the air entering the cleaner will not come into
intimate contact with the carpet. In that event, its cleaning
efficiency will be greatly reduced. The author has not had an
opportunity to make any comparative tests of this form of
renovator.</p>

<p>When Mr. Spencer introduced the centrifugal fan as a
vacuum producer, he also brought out a series of carpet renovators<span class="pagenum" id="Page31">[31]</span>
of various forms and sizes. One had a cleaning slot
³⁄₄-in. wide and 10-in. long, another a slot 15-in. long, ¹⁄₄-in.
wide at its end, increasing to ³⁄₄-in. at the center. Another
had a slot 20-in. long and ³⁄₈-in. wide, and finally he adopted a
tool with a cleaning slot 15-in. long and ¹⁄₂-in. wide throughout
its length. This is merely the re-entrance into the field of the
wide-slot tool first used by Mr. Kenney and its successful operation
depends on its use with a vacuum producer of such characteristics
and a hose and pipe line of such proportions that
practically a constant vacuum is maintained within the renovator,
regardless of the quantity of air passing through the
tool. The latest form of this renovator, as used by Mr. Spencer,
is illustrated in <a href="#Fig16">Fig. 16</a>. At the time that the writer made tests
on renovators of this make, the majority of the tests were made
with a renovator having a cleaning slot 10-in. long and ³⁄₄-in.
wide. This renovator is designated as Type F, while the
15-in. × ¹⁄₄-in. to ³⁄₄-in. slot is designated as Type F¹.</p>

<p class="allclear">About seven years ago the Supervising Architect of the
United States Treasury Department gave consideration to the
use of a carpet cleaning test to determine the acceptability of
any vacuum cleaning system which might be installed in any of
the buildings under his control. The author was instructed
to make a series of tests of carpet renovators, with a view of
determining: (1) the feasibility of using a carpet cleaning test
to determine the merits of a vacuum cleaning system; (2) to<span class="pagenum" id="Page32">[32]</span>
fix the requirements to be incorporated in a specification where
the acceptance of the system was dependent on a satisfactory
carpet cleaning test, to be made at the building after the completion
of the installation; (3) to determine what requirements,
other than a cleaning test, would be necessary to obtain a
first-class cleaning system.</p>

<p>The record of many such tests was shown to the author, shortly
before he began making tests. These purported to have been
made by Prof. Miller at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
with a pump furnished by the Sanitary Devices Manufacturing
Company, in which the efficiency of the inrush type
of renovator (Type C) and the straight vacuum renovator
(Type A) was compared. The results of these tests, as given
in a brief resumé, which was distributed by the Sanitary
Devices Manufacturing Co., indicated that the Type C renovator
was the more rapid and efficient cleaner.</p>

<p>The author learned that these tests were made by the undergraduate
students as a part of the regular laboratory work,
and that later a series of tests was made as the basis of a
thesis by Messrs. Paterson and Phelps in 1906, using the above-described
apparatus. The following year another series of tests
was made by Mr. Stewart R. Miller, as the basis of an undergraduate
thesis, in which the efficiencies of the piston pump and
inrush sweeper of the Sanitary Devices Manufacturing Co.
were compared with those of the steam aspirator and straight
vacuum renovator of the American Air Cleaner Company. A
copy of this thesis was furnished the author by the Sanitary
Devices Manufacturing Company shortly after the completion
of the tests made by the author.</p>

<p>The relative efficiency of the two types of renovators reported
by these tests differed widely in each case, an occurrence
which is liable to happen where undergraduate students are
engaged in such work. They were, therefore, considered as of
doubtful reliability.</p>

<p>The author could find no record of any tests made by anyone
of longer experience and, indeed, these were the only tests of
which he could find any record.</p>

<p>As the author desired to specify a cleaning test which could
be readily repeated at the building in which the cleaning system<span class="pagenum" id="Page33">[33]</span>
was installed, which building was likely to be located in
any part of the United States, no exhaustive laboratory methods
were desired or attempted. As the building was likely to be
located in a city where no other vacuum cleaning systems were
then installed and in a new building in which no dirty carpets
were available, and as it was not desirable to have the contractor
furnish the material for the test, it was considered necessary
to use some material in soiling carpets which would be
readily obtainable anywhere, which could be readily brought to
a standard, and which, when worked into the carpets in a
reasonable length of time, would be as difficult to remove as
the dirt found in the average dirty carpet.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Tests on Dirty Carpets.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">—As no tests of cleaning an actually
dirty carpet were on record, quicksand having been used in the
Institute of Technology tests, it was necessary to first clean
some carpets that had been soiled in actual daily service in
order to obtain a standard with which to compare the results
in removing various substances, which it was intended to try
as a substitute for dirt. A carpet which had been in actual use
for a number of years on the floors of the old United States
Mint building, in Philadelphia, and receiving the ordinary
amount of cleaning, was procured. This was a Brussels carpet
with a glue-sized back, containing about 20 sq. yds. It
was divided into three approximately equal parts.</p>

<p>An indicator was attached to the vacuum pump for taking
air measurements, and it was found that there was considerable
leakage of air into the system through the connections to
the separators and at other points, therefore the pump was
operated with 22 in. of vacuum in the separator and a card taken
with all outlets closed and the amount of leakage noted. During
the tests this degree of vacuum was always maintained in
the separators and pipe lines and the vacuum in the renovator
was varied throughout the tests by throttling the hose cock.
This manner of making tests gave a practically constant leakage
which was deducted from the quantities shown by the
indicator cards taken with the renovators in operation.</p>

<p>As the writer had already made many tests of the efficiency
of various types of vacuum pumps as air movers under various
degrees of vacuum, and as the capacity of the pump available<span class="pagenum" id="Page34">[34]</span>
was far in excess of that required to operate one renovator,
no attempt to obtain the efficiency of the plant as a unit was
made. Instead, the vacuum at the hose cock was adjusted until
the degree obtained was what the writer had found to be within
the limit obtained in practice. The resulting vacuum at the
renovator was then noted.</p>

<p>Each piece of carpet was cleaned during six periods of one
minute each, using a different vacuum at the tool for each
piece of carpet. The carpets were weighed at the beginning
of the test and after each one-minute period. At the conclusion
of these tests each carpet was cleaned until no change of weight
occurred after two minutes’ cleaning. They were then considered
as being 100% clean and this standard was made a
basis for computing the percentage of dirt removal. A renovator
of Type C was used in these tests.</p>

<p>Shortly afterward a similar test was made on a dirty carpet
of 4.6 sq. yds. area, using a renovator of Type F. This carpet
was also a Brussels, with glue-sized back, which had been in
use in the shoe department of a large department store in
Hartford. These carpets contained approximately 2 oz. of dust
per square yard, none of which was visible on the surface, and
they were probably as clean as the average carpet after being
gone over with a carpet sweeper or after a light application
of a broom.</p>

<p>As the sizes of the carpets used in making the tests were not
always the same, allowance has been made for this variation by
using, in the case of Type F renovator, instead of the true
time, a calculated time which allows each renovator the same
time for cleaning 1 sq. yd. of carpet. For instance, in the case
of the small carpet cleaned with Type F renovator, an interval
of 60 × 4.6 ÷ 6, or 46 seconds, was taken as equal to one minute’s
cleaning of the carpet with types A and C renovators. Such
interval is stated and plotted as one minute in the <a href="#Table1">table</a> opposite,
which gives the results of cleaning dirty carpets with the three
types of renovators.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Type A Renovator Most Efficient on Dirty Carpets.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">—The
results of the tests of the three types of renovators, each
when it was operated with the highest vacuum under the renovator,
are plotted in <a href="#Fig17">Fig. 17</a> in order that a ready comparison
may be made. This curve indicates that Type A renovator
does more effective cleaning in less time than either of the other
two types tested.</p>

<p class="caption">FIG. 17. TESTS OF THREE RENOVATORS ON DIRTY CARPETS.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>Referring to the second line of the table, which gives the
degree of vacuum obtained in the renovator during the tests,
it will be noted that the highest vacuum attained with each
type of renovator is practically the same. This degree of<span class="pagenum" id="Page36">[36]</span>
vacuum was obtained with the average vacuum at the hose cock,
using 100 ft. of hose in each case, and corresponds to that obtained
in the commercial operation of each of the renovators
with the vacuum producers ordinarily used, which was 15 in. in
the case of Type C, 10 in. in case of Type A, and 5 in. in case
of Type F, the hose being the size used by each of the systems
as marketed.</p>

<p>The third line, which shows the cubic feet of free air per
minute passing the renovator, indicates that Type A renovator
requires much less air at the same degree of vacuum than
either of the other types to do better work.</p>

<p>From the readings in these two lines the horse power required
at the renovator, to move the air that passes same is obtained
with 100% efficiency adiabatic compression. The results are
tabulated in the ninth line of the table.</p>

<p>This indicates that Type A renovator does more effective
work with about 50% of the power required by either of the
other types of renovators.</p>

<p>The tenth line gives the rate of cleaning and again shows
Type A renovator to be the most rapid cleaner.</p>

<p>The eleventh line gives the horse power required at the renovator
when in operation, from which it will be seen that effective
cleaning cannot be accomplished with less than ¹⁄₄ H. P.
at the renovator.</p>

<p>Attention is called to the great reduction in power in case of
Type A renovator when the vacuum at the tool is reduced from
4¹⁄₂ in. to 2 in. and to the small reduction in the efficiency
which results from this great reduction in power. This is
not the case with the Type C renovator, where there is a considerable
reduction in the already low efficiency with each
reduction in the vacuum. This characteristic of Type A renovator
is discussed further on in the chapter on <a href="#Page80">hose</a>.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Tests of Carpets “Artificially” Soiled.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">—Having determined
the efficiency of the various types of renovators when operated
on dirty carpets, the author then attempted to find some substance
easily obtained anywhere which could be used as a substitute
for actual dirt, and which would give approximately
equal results with these obtained on dirty carpets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page37">[37]</span></p>

<p>A test of this character was made by the author some time
previous to the tests of dirty carpets and was made on a Wilton
velvet rug of about 12 sq. yds. area. The material spread on
same was ordinary wheat flour, as used in demonstrations, 3 lbs.
of which were placed on the rug and rubbed in with sticks of
wood as well as possible and the rug cleaned for three minutes,
using a Type A renovator attached to the separator with 50 ft.
of 1-in. diameter hose. The results were as follows:</p>

<p>The vacuum at the renovator was not measured at the time
of making this test and its amount is not exactly known, but
further tests with this type of renovator under nearly the same
conditions gave the following results:</p>

<table class="standard">

<p class="noindent">and it is probable that the vacuum at the renovator during
these tests was approximately the same.</p>

<p>Comparison of the results of this test, in which 4 sq. yds. of
carpet were cleaned per minute, with those of the tests of dirty
carpets, in which only 1 sq. yd. was cleaned per minute, indicates
that wheat flour is not a suitable substitute for dirt in
making a carpet cleaning test.</p>

<p>The author, believing that flour is of sufficient fineness, but
not of sufficient weight, tried Portland cement, which is very
heavy and at the same time exceedingly fine, as a substitute for
dirt in soiling carpets. The same carpet that had been cleaned
in Philadelphia was used and 6¹⁄₂ oz. of cement was worked
into the same. It was then cleaned with a Type C renovator,
with a vacuum of 2¹⁄₂ in. hg. at the renovator and 95% of the
cement was removed in two minutes’ cleaning, as against 59%
of the dirt in the carpet when received.</p>

<p>Ordinary dirt, taken from some flower pots which had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page38">[38]</span>
left dry for some time, was then tried with the same carpet,
using a Type C renovator and 1 in. hg. With this arrangement,
71¹⁄₂% of the dirt was removed in two minutes as against
52% of the dirt in the carpet as received.</p>

<p>This dirt was then mixed with water to a thin mud and
spread over the carpet and the carpet dried before cleaning.
Then 11¹⁄₄ oz. of this material was worked into 6 sq. yds. of
carpet and a Type C renovator removed 100% of this in four
minutes’ cleaning, with a vacuum of 2¹⁄₂ in. hg. at the tool as
against 72% of the dirt in the carpet as received.</p>

<p>The author’s ingenuity being about exhausted, he referred
to the test of Mr. Stewart R. Miller in which quicksand which
would pass a 50-mesh to the inch screen was used, a long-napped
Brussels carpet being filled with 5¹⁄₂ oz. per square
yard and cleaned with Types A and C renovators.</p>

<p>This test indicated that a nearer approach to the results in
cleaning dirty carpets was possible with this substance than
with any which the author had tried. The author repeated Mr.
Miller’s test, using a Type F renovator, 10-in. × ³⁄₄-in. cleaning
slot, and also a Type F¹ renovator, 15-in. × ¹⁄₄-in. to ³⁄₄-in.
cleaning slot. In duplicating these tests the author was associated
with Mr. E. L. Wilson, a graduate of the Institute, who
was familiar with the methods used by Mr. Miller. With his
assistance, the conditions of Mr. Miller’s tests were almost exactly
duplicated. The results of Mr. Miller’s and the author’s
tests are given in the <a href="#Table2">table</a> opposite, correction being made in
the time of cleaning proportional to the size of carpets used, to
allow the same time for cleaning 1 sq. yd. of carpet by each
renovator.</p>

<p>The results of these tests are shown graphically in <a href="#Fig18">Fig. 18</a>.
Comparison of these curves with the curves of cleaning dirty
carpets (<a href="#Fig17">Fig. 17</a>), shows a falling off in the efficiency of cleaning
by Type A renovator while there is a gain in the efficiency
in cleaning by all of the other types of renovators, Type C
being now nearly as efficient as Type A, while Types F and F¹
renovators are now more efficient than Type A. This result
must be due either to the increased quantity of material to be
removed, 5¹⁄₂ oz. per square yard in case of the sand as against
2 oz. per square yard in case of the dirt, or else to the change
in the character of the material removed, the sand having much
sharper surfaces than would be encountered in case of dirt
which must necessarily be ground under the feet before it
reaches the carpet, or to the longer nap of the carpet.</p>

<p>The results of these tests at the higher vacua are shown
graphically in <a href="#Fig19">Fig. 19</a>. Comparison of these curves with those
obtained when removing sand from a long napped carpet (<a href="#Fig18">Fig.
18</a>), shows:</p>

<p>First, a marked increase in the efficiency of Type A renovator,
this being slightly better than obtained when cleaning
a dirty carpet.</p>

<p>Second, practically no change in the efficiency of Type C
renovator.</p>

<p>Third, a small decrease in the efficiency of Type F renovator,
which still shows a much higher efficiency than when cleaning
dirty carpets.</p>

<p>In order to determine how much, if any, of these changes
in the behavior of the renovators was due to the increase in
the quantity of material to be removed, the horizontal line,
representing 1 oz. of sand remaining in the long-napped carpet,<span class="pagenum" id="Page41">[41]</span>
was drawn on <a href="#Fig18">Fig. 18</a> and, using this as a base line, it will be
seen that Type A renovator removes this remaining material
in three minutes, the same time as was required to remove the
same amount from the short-napped carpet. However, the first
4¹⁄₂ oz. of sand have been removed from the long-napped carpet
in three minutes, or at a rate 4¹⁄₂ times as fast as the last
1 oz. was removed. This indicates that the narrow slot renovator
is capable of handling more material than is likely to be
encountered in any dirty carpet and that the apparent decrease
in the efficiency of this renovator is not due to the increased
quantity of material to be removed.</p>

<div class="container w30emmax" id="Fig19">

<img src="images/illo041.jpg" alt="">

<p class="caption">FIG. 19. CLEANING TESTS USING 1 OZ. OF SAND PER SQUARE
YARD OF CARPET.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>It will be noted that the Type C renovator removed the last
1 oz. per square yard from the long-napped carpet in the same
time that was required by Type A renovator, while it needed
nearly twice as long to remove this amount of material from
the short-napped carpet (<a href="#Fig19">Fig. 19</a>). This renovator, however,
was slower in removing the first 4¹⁄₂ oz. per square yard.</p>

<p>Type F renovator removed the last 1 oz. per square yard
from the long-napped carpet in two minutes, while it required
twice this time to remove the same amount from the short-napped
carpet. This renovator also removed the first 4¹⁄₂ oz.
per square yard from the long-napped carpet in two minutes,
while it required three minutes for Type A and 3-³⁄₄ minutes<span class="pagenum" id="Page42">[42]</span>
for Type C renovators to remove the same quantity. It is,
therefore, evident that sand is removed more rapidly from a
long than from a short-napped carpet when a wide slot renovator
is used. The same time is required to remove small quantities
of sand from a long or short-napped carpet with a narrow
slot.</p>

<p>This phenomenon is probably due to the sand being held in
the carpets by the adhesion of its sharp edges to the sides of
the nap, this being more pronounced in the case of the long-napped
carpet where it is easier to work the material out of
sight without grinding it into intimate contact with the pile
of the carpet. When the wide-slot renovator passes over the
carpet, the carpet is arched up into the slot and the upper ends
of the nap separated. The longer the nap or the wider the
slot, the greater will be this separation. With the long-napped
carpet this separation will at once release the sand, while, in
case of the short nap, there is less separation and also more adhesion
of the sand to the pile of the carpet, due to the harder
grinding necessary to work the material out of sight. Therefore,
the wider the cleaning slot used, the faster the sand will
be removed, as is evident by comparison of the tests of Types
F and F¹ renovators on the long-napped carpet.</p>

<p>With the narrow slot renovator the arching of the carpet
under the cleaning slot is negligible and no advantage is gained
when using this type of renovator to remove sand from a long-napped
carpet. It is also possible that the nap of the carpet
may be longer than the width of the cleaning slot, in which
case the nap will not snap back to a vertical position when it is
under the cleaning slot, but will be pressed down and will impair
the action of the renovator. The author considers that
the width of the slot should always be greater than the length
of the nap of the carpet in order to do effective cleaning.</p>

<p>Shortly after making the above-described tests, the author
had occasion to make somewhat similar tests, using a sand-filled
carpet, in an attempt to try out a proposed carpet cleaning
test intended to be used as a standard for use in specifications
for a vacuum cleaning system. When a Wilton carpet was
used, it was found that neither Type A or C renovator would
fulfill the test requirements, which were within the results<span class="pagenum" id="Page43">[43]</span>
obtained in tests already described. Unfortunately a Type F
renovator was not available, but the author is of the opinion
that it would have done better.</p>

<p>The test was then repeated, using a Brussels carpet and the
test requirement was easily met. This discovery led the author
to make further tests of carpets of different makes, filled with
sand and cleaned under the same conditions which yielded far
from uniform or satisfactory results, and the use of a cleaning
test, where artificially-soiled carpets are used, was abandoned.</p>

<p>The author is of the opinion that no substance artificially
applied to a carpet, other than regular sweepings, will give anything
like the same results as will be obtained in actual cleaning.
Sand seems to be the only substance which can be worked into
the carpet that is nearly as difficult to remove as the actual
dirt found in carpets, and, in many cases, this material gives
results that are misleading and unfair to some types of renovators.
No test which uses a carpet artificially soiled with
artificially prepared dirt is considered to be of any value in
determining the relative efficiency of various types of carpet
renovators.</p>

<p>A series of tests was made by Mr. Sidney A. Reeve consulting
engineer, of New York City, in October, 1910, at the
works of the Vacuum Cleaner Company, Plainfield, N. J., in
which the conditions were such as would give much more uniform
results than were possible in the tests made by the author.</p>

<p>In making these tests the renovator was held firmly clamped
in any desired position in a wooden carriage rolling upon a
straight wooden track. The portion of the carriage supporting
the sweeper is attached to the remainder of the carriage by
hinges, so that the sweeper is free to seek its own contact with
the carpet. The carriage was given a reciprocating motion by
its attachment to a large bell crank, which in turn received
its motion from the factory shafting. The construction of the
bell crank was such that the driving power could be readily
thrown in and out of gear at any time.</p>

<p>The carpet was stretched tightly upon a platen which was
fitted for movement across the line of motion of the sweeper,
along straight guides suitably attached to the floor. The ends<span class="pagenum" id="Page44">[44]</span>
of the carpet were first wedged tightly in clamps and the
clamps wedged apart so as to stretch the carpet.</p>

<p>The tests consisted in first weighing the carpet, then stretching
it upon the platen, then sprinkling thereon a suitable and
known weight of dirt taken from the separators of the company’s
machines, from which the lint and coarse, fibrous material
had been sifted and which was thoroughly trodden into
the fibres of the carpet, whereupon the sweeper was set in motion
for a given number of strokes.</p>

<p>In nearly all cases the tests were repeated upon the same
piece of carpet, with the same charge of dirt, by repeatedly
placing the carpet in the frame and giving it a further and
more extended cleaning.</p>

<p>All tests were corroborated by repetition before being admitted
to the records. Every effort was made to have the tests
approach the conditions occurring in actual practice, as nearly
as possible, and still keep them definite and measurable.</p>

<p>The carpet used was a Wilton, of the standard width of
27 in. and something over a yard long, and the sweeper was
given a stroke of 34 in. at the rate of 40 strokes per minute.
The sweepers were attached to a 6-ft. tubular handle, ¹⁵⁄₁₆-in.
inside diameter, and connected to the separator by 50 ft. of
1-in. diameter hose.</p>

<p>Before making any tests, the piston pump used in the experiments
was calibrated by pumping through a rotary meter
and the amount of air moved per revolution for each degree
of vacuum from open inlet to closed system was carefully determined.
In making the tests of various renovators, each renovator
was allowed to pass the same amount of air as the others
tested in comparison therewith and the vacuum at the renovator
and at the separator was allowed to be what was necessary
to pass this known amount of air through the renovators.
This method is widely different from that used by the author
where the degree of vacuum at the renovator head was determined
and used as a limiting factor, the quantity of air being
allowed to vary as necessary to produce this vacuum.</p>

<p>The results of three series of tests are given in <a href="#Fig20">Fig. 20</a>, which
shows those obtained with Kenney Type A renovators, having
a face 12¹⁄₂ in. × ⁷⁄₈ in. and a cleaning slot 11¹⁄₂ in. × ⁵⁄₃₂ in.<span class="pagenum" id="Page45">[45]</span>
Curve A was made with the angle of the handle such as would
give as near as possible a perfect contact of the sweeper with
the carpet. Curve B was made with the sweeper handle canted
5° below the proper angle. Curve C was made with the sweeper
handle raised approximately 15° above the proper angle. The
ordinates represented the amount of dust in the carpet in
40ths of a pound, also reduced by the author to ounces, and the
abscissae the number of strokes made by the sweeper.</p>

<p>Curves B and C show the loss in efficiency which occurs when
the renovator is canted from its proper position on the carpet.
This falling off in efficiency will necessarily be greater the
wider the face of the renovator, as is shown in further tests
by Mr. Reeve, using a Type C renovator, which tests also
show that this renovator gives a slightly higher efficiency
when operated with the inrush slot stopped, as is shown in
<a href="#Fig21">Fig. 21</a>.</p>

<p>In this curve the ordinates represent the per cent. of normal
dirt, <i>i. e.</i>, the amount likely to be found in a dirty carpet, remaining
in the carpet at any stage of the cleaning, and the
abscissae the number of strokes that have been made by the
sweeper. Heavy solid lines represent the results with the inrush
open and dotted lines the results with the inrush stopped. The
figures on the curve represent the degree to which the handle
has been varied from the position giving the best results in
cleaning.</p>

angle for cleaning.</p>

<p>Since the method of making these tests is entirely different
from that used by the author, a comparison of the results, with
any assurance that the same conditions existed in both cases, is
impossible. It occurred to the author that a comparison of the
results of the tests by Mr. Reeve, using a carpet artificially
filled with actual dirt taken from carpets, with the tests made
by the author on carpets naturally soiled, would tend to show
if equal results could be obtained by a vacuum cleaner by
artificially soiling a carpet with dirt taken from another carpet,
and in cleaning a carpet naturally soiled.</p>

Philadelphia carpet with the small-sized Type A renovator
(11-in. × ¹⁄₂-in. face and 10-in. × ³⁄₁₆-in. cleaning slot). The
carpet used by the author contained 6 sq. yds. and was held
in cleaning by a weight at each corner, while the carpet used
by Mr. Reeve was ³⁄₄ yd. wide and cleaned for approximately
one yard of its length, the relative size being 1 to 8. The time
of cleaning was 6 min. in the author’s test which would correspond
to ³⁄₄-min. cleaning in Mr. Reeve’s test, or 30 strokes of
the sweeper. The total dust in the carpet in Mr. Reeve’s test
was ⁵⁄₄₀ lbs., or 2.66 oz. per square yard, and his test is
compared with the author’s test with the carpet containing 2
oz. per square yard. Calculation of the per cent. of total<span class="pagenum" id="Page48">[48]</span>

<p>The above comparison was made using curve A, <a href="#Fig20">Fig. 20</a>,
with the sweeper at its best angle with the floor. The close
agreement of the two tests indicates that a carpet artificially
soiled with dirt actually removed from another carpet by a
vacuum cleaner is as difficult to remove as dirt which has been
worked into a carpet by ordinary daily use. This condition
does not result when any other substance is used to artificially
soil the carpet, as will readily be seen by reference to the tests
of carpets filled with sand and other substances which have
been described in this chapter.</p>

<p>A comparative test of three different renovators was recently
made by the author. Renovator No. 1 had a cleaning slot
14 in. long by ³⁄₄ in. wide, the edges of the slot being a segment
of a circle having a ¹⁄₈-in. radius. This form of cleaning
surface allows very small area of contact with the surface
cleaned and permits the admission of large air volumes, about
56 cu. ft., with 2-in. vacuum. It is practically a Type F renovator,
similar to that used in the tests at Hartford.</p>

<p>Renovator No. 2 had a cleaning slot 9¹⁄₂ in. long and ¹⁄₄ in.
wide, the face of the renovator being approximately ⁷⁄₈ in.
wide and practically a plain surface, a typical Type B renovator.</p>

<p>Renovator No. 3 had a cleaning slot 7¹⁄₄ in. long and ¹⁄₈ in.<span class="pagenum" id="Page49">[49]</span>
wide, the face of the renovator being ³⁄₈ in. wide and the
edges slightly rounded, a typical Type A renovator.</p>

<p>The carpet used was a Colonial velvet rug with ¹⁄₈-in. nap,
closely woven, containing 6 sq. yds. This rug was filled with
12 oz. of dirt taken from separators of cleaning machines,
from which the lint and litter had been screened. This was
rubbed into the carpet until no dirt was visible on the surface,
the surface being then lightly swept with a brush and weighed.</p>

<p>In cleaning this carpet the renovator was passed once over
the entire surface at the rate of about 70 ft. per minute. This
required six strokes and 50 seconds for No. 1 cleaner, nine
strokes and 77 seconds for No. 2 cleaner, and 12 strokes and
100 seconds for No. 3 cleaner.</p>

<p>The carpet was then weighed, spread down and gone over
three times, weighed, spread down and gone over four times.
This operation was repeated until the carpet came within ¹⁄₂ oz.
of its weight when received.</p>

<p>Each of the three renovators was operated with a vacuum
of 2 in. at the renovator.</p>

<p>The results of these tests are illustrated by curves 1A, 2A and
3A in <a href="#Fig23">Fig. 23</a>. This shows that to remove 95% of the dirt
the renovator had to be passed over the carpet 20 times for
No. 1 renovator, 15 times for No. 2 renovator and 8 times for
No. 3 renovator.</p>

<p>Similar tests were then made with each of the renovators,
with a vacuum of 4.5 in. of mercury at the renovator. The
results are shown by curves 1B, 2B and 3B (<a href="#Fig23">Fig. 23</a>) These
show that to remove 95% of the dirt the renovator had to be
passed over the carpet 11 times with No. 1 renovator, 6¹⁄₂ times
with No. 2, and 4¹⁄₂ times with No. 3.</p>

<p>These tests are all on the same carpet, with the same quantity
of the same dirt and with the renovators moved at the
same speed in each case. The comparison of the results should
give a fair indication of the efficiency of the different types
of renovators at different degrees of vacuum within the renovator
and, therefore, form the most conclusive proof of the
statements relative to the efficiency of renovators as given in
this chapter.</p>

<p>All cleaning tests that the author has observed indicate that<span class="pagenum" id="Page50">[50]</span>
the higher the vacuum within the renovator the more rapid
and effective the cleaning, and that the efficiency of the renovator
is fully as high with a small as with a large volume of
air passing through the renovator and with the same degree of
vacuum within same. Therefore, the most effective and economical
renovator should be that which gives the highest
vacuum with the least air passing.</p>

<p class="caption">FIG. 23. TESTS SHOWING EFFICIENCY OF DIFFERENT TYPES
OF RENOVATORS AT DIFFERENT DEGREES
OF VACUUM.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>If the degree of vacuum within the renovator be carried to
an abnormally high degree, there will be a tendency for the
renovator to cling so close to the carpet that its operation will
be difficult and the wear on the carpet rapid. The production<span class="pagenum" id="Page51">[51]</span>
of this high vacuum, with a larger quantity of air exhausted,
will result in the expenditure of power at the renovator
in excess of the gain in efficiency and speed of cleaning.</p>

<p>It is evident that the wider the cleaning slot, the greater will
be the tendency of the renovator to stick to the carpet with a
high vacuum within the same. The author has experienced no
difficulty in operating the 10-in. renovator, with ³⁄₁₆-in. cleaning
slot, with a vacuum as high as 9 in. of mercury, but wider-slot
renovators always push hard when any high degree of
vacuum exists within them.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Effort Necessary to Operate Various Types of Renovators.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">—The
author made a series of tests to determine the effort
necessary to operate the various types of renovators under different
conditions. In making these tests the renovator was attached
to a spring balance and pulled along the floor, the pull
required to move the renovator being observed by the reading
of the balance. Three types of renovators were used in this
test: Type A, having a cleaning slot ⁵⁄₁₆ in. wide and 12 in.
long; Type C, having a cleaning slot ⁵⁄₁₆ in. wide and 12 in.
long, with an auxiliary inrush slot ¹⁄₄ in-wide and 12 in. long;
Type F, having a cleaning slot ³⁄₄ in. wide and 10 in. long. The
results were as follows:</p>

<p>It may be noted that, when operating on the Brussels and
the glue-sized velvet, the pull required to move all types of
renovators bears a direct ratio to the degree of vacuum under<span class="pagenum" id="Page52">[52]</span>
the renovator, and that the quantity of air exhausted is the
same for each renovator on either carpet, but different for each
type of renovator. It is evident that, in this case, very little
air enters the renovator by passing up through the carpet, and
hence the action of the inrush slot on Type C renovator is
noticeable only to a slight degree. When operating on velvet
carpet, without glue-sized back, the inrush slot, in conjunction
with the greater quantity of air coming through the carpet,
has caused the passage of a large quantity of air, while
the vacuum maintained at the renovator is greatly reduced
over that which was maintained under Type A renovator when
the same quantity of air was passing. In this case, nearly all
of the air entering Type A renovator came from the under
side of the carpet. The effect on the efficiency of cleaning with
Type C renovator under these conditions can readily be imagined,
by reference to former tests, as being greatly reduced
over that of Type A when passing the same quantity of air.
With linoleum, the action of the inrush slot of the Type C
renovator has again greatly reduced the vacuum under the
renovator, although the quantity of air is much in excess of
that passing Type A renovator. The difference in the behavior
of the renovators on different makes of carpet is seen to be
due largely to the difference in the quantity of air which passes
up through the carpet into the renovator.</p>

<p>It is evident that, with the same degree of vacuum within
the renovator, all types are equally easy to push and that, if
the vacuum within the renovator becomes higher than is necessary
to produce good cleaning results, unnecessary effort will
be required to operate the renovator.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Relative Damage to Carpets with Various Types of Renovators.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">—A
few tests have been made by the author to determine
the relative damage to carpets with the various types of
renovators in use and it is found that, when the edges of the
renovators are made exceedingly sharp, considerable nap is
pulled out. However, if the edges are made slightly rounding
and not too narrow, no undue wear will occur with any of the
types of renovators described, provided the vacuum in the
renovator is not permitted to become greater than 5 in. of
mercury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page53">[53]</span></p>

<p>The author considers that for best results the vacuum should
not be less than 3¹⁄₂ in. of mercury at the renovator and that
at least 2 in. is necessary to do even fair work, while, to permit
easy operation and prevent undue wear on the carpets, it
should not be higher than 5 in.</p>

<p>Before deciding which type of renovator will be most economical
to use in any case the character of the cleaning to be
done must be considered.</p>

<p>Of the various types of renovators considered in this chapter,
Type C can be dismissed at once, as it is neither as effective
a dust remover as Types A or F nor will it remove litter any
more effectively than Type F. Tests of Type D renovator do
not show as good results as a dust remover as Type A, nor
will it remove litter any more effectively. Type E renovator
is a modification of Type C and is not likely to be any better.</p>

<p>The selection, therefore, lies between Type A and Type F
renovators, the former being by far the best dust remover,
while the latter will pick up a limited amount of small litter,
such as matches, cigar and cigarette stumps, and small bits of
paper. Where large quantities of these articles are likely to
be encountered, it is more important that the renovator should
be capable of picking them up, but, unfortunately, when these
articles are met with, there are also likely to be much larger
articles present that cannot be picked up by any but a specially-designed
renovator, and other means must be employed to
remove them.</p>

<p>In residences, private offices and nearly every place where
carpets or rugs are likely to be used, waste baskets and cuspidors
are provided and the articles mentioned are deposited in them
rather than on the floor. Thus, the renovator will be required
to remove dust, cigar ashes and sand or mud only, all of which
can be readily removed with a Type A renovator with less expenditure
of power than with a Type F renovator.</p>

<p>Public places, such as ante-rooms, reception rooms and other
offices to which the general public is admitted in great numbers
and which are sometimes carpeted, are likely to contain
articles which can be picked up by Type F renovator and not
by Type A. For cleaning such places, a Type F renovator is
necessary, although it requires considerably more power, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page54">[54]</span>
the author sees no reason why this type of renovator should be
used to the exclusion of Type A, even in buildings containing
rooms of this character. If the building also contains several
rooms where litter will not be encountered, the author would
recommend that both types of renovators be used, each in its
proper place, and thereby cause a considerable saving of power
in cleaning rooms where no litter is encountered.</p>

<p>For residence work there is little need of providing carpet
renovators capable of picking up litter and, also, there will be
very little bare floor cleaning to be done, which requires larger
volumes of air. A smaller capacity exhausting plant, therefore,
can be installed, if the Type A renovator is adopted.</p>

<p>In large office buildings where all cleaning is done after office
hours, where the building is provided with its own power plant,
and where speed of cleaning and ability to clean all apartments
with the fewest tools to be carried by the cleaners is desired,
it appears to be better to use only Type F renovators for all
carpet work, as the extra power required will not be of vital
importance.</p>

<p>Summing up the matter, the author believes that both Type
A and F renovators have their uses in their proper places but
that Type A has the widest field of usefulness, yet it need not
invade the field of the other. He also believes that this fact
will be realized by manufacturers in the near future, when the
two types of renovators will work together side by side for the
general good of the manufacturers and the users.</p>

<p>The renovator which is next in importance to the carpet
renovator is that used for cleaning bare floors. The earliest
form of this renovator was the oscillating floor type introduced
by Mr. Kenney. This was a modification of the narrow-slot
carpet renovator introduced by him. The body of same
was curved and supported on two small wheels or rollers, with
the intention of bringing the cleaning slot close to the surface
cleaned without its touching same, as indicated in <a href="#Fig24">Fig. 24</a>.</p>

<p class="allclear">This form of renovator was found to be impracticable for
the reason that any change in the angle with which the stem
or tube connecting the body of the renovator with the handle
in relation to the surface cleaned tended to make its action
ineffective. If the angle were made less the distance between
the cleaning slot and the floor was increased, allowing the air
to enter the cleaning slot without coming in contact with the
surface to be cleaned, or, if the angle were made greater, it
would cause the face of the renovator to strike and damage
the surface of the floor.</p>

<p>The wheels or rollers on which this renovator was mounted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page56">[56]</span>
being so small, were subject to rapid wear both on their faces
and in their bearings, and when these wheels were slightly worn
the renovator was practically useless. On account of the above
defects this form of renovator was abandoned shortly after its
introduction.</p>

<p>The next form of renovator to be tried was a modification
of the ordinary soft bristle brush, such as had been in general
use for cleaning hard wood floors. The bristles were arranged
around the edges of the cleaning slot, in the body, which was
shaped similar to the slot in the carpet renovator. Rubber or
leather curtains or skirting, extending nearly to the ends of
the bristles, was placed inside of these bristles in order to cause
the air in entering the body of the renovator to come into
intimate contact with the surface to be cleaned. The general
form of this type is shown in <a href="#Fig25">Fig. 25</a>.</p>

<p class="caption">FIG. 26. ANOTHER TYPE OF BARE FLOOR RENOVATOR.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>This form of renovator, while more efficient than the oscillating
floor type, still had its faults in that it had a tendency
to push the dirt along the floor in front of it, much
the same as the floor brush from which it was copied was
designed to do. Also, there was too much tendency for the air
to pass into the body of the renovator without coming into intimate
contact with the surface to be cleaned. While this type
of floor renovator or a slight modification thereof is still in<span class="pagenum" id="Page57">[57]</span>
use by several manufacturers today, it never has and never will
be an effective bare floor cleaner.</p>

<p>A modification of this type of bare floor renovator, in which
the bristles have been shortened and made thicker, the skirting
or flaps placed on the outside and the stem provided with a
swivel joint, is shown in <a href="#Fig26">Fig. 26</a>. Such an arrangement is
an improvement over the former type as, owing to its wider
and shorter mass of bristles, there is less tendency for the air
to pass into the body of the renovator without coming into intimate
contact with the surface cleaned. It is still prone to push
its dirt before it and is far from being a perfect bare floor
cleaner.</p>

<p class="caption">FIG. 27. BARE FLOOR RENOVATOR WITH FELT CLEANING
SURFACE.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The next modification in the bare floor renovator was the
abandoning of the bristle brush in favor of a cleaning surface
composed of felt as shown in <a href="#Fig27">Fig. 27</a>. In this form of renovator
the air entering the body of the same must pass either
between the felt and the surface cleaned or through the felt
itself, and this air quantity is small. Since this renovator
has a wider cleaning slot than the Type A carpet renovator,
and, as it is used with the same vacuum producer, hose and
pipe lines, a considerable degree of vacuum will be produced
under same, especially when operated on polished floors, where
the conditions are nearly the same as we observed with Type
A carpet renovator operated on linoleum. With the wider
slot, the effort to move these renovators becomes too great for
easy operation. This trouble can be overcome by using a soft
grade of felt which permits sufficient air to pass through its
open pores to reduce the vacuum under same and permit easy
operation. Unfortunately, this felt is subject to rapid wear
when operated on surfaces as hard as floors and its use has<span class="pagenum" id="Page58">[58]</span>
been abandoned in favor of a harder felt. Openings are left
in the felt to permit the passage of sufficient air to reduce the
vacuum in the renovator to working limits. These slots have
taken many forms. In one form the felt was placed in alternate
X and diamond shapes, glued to the face with small open spaces
between them, as illustrated in <a href="#Fig28">Fig. 28</a>. However, as these
small pieces must be held in place by glue, they are easily
broken loose and the efficiency of the renovator impaired.</p>

<div class="container w40emmax" id="Fig28">

<img src="images/illo058a.jpg" alt="">

<p class="caption">FIG. 28. BARE FLOOR RENOVATOR WITH UNUSUAL FORM
OF SLOT.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>Another method, which has now become standard, is to open
the ends of the renovator sufficiently to permit easy operation.
This method produces high velocities at these end openings
which are very effective in cleaning close to walls and in corners,
where large quantities of dust always lodge and are removed
with difficulty without these open slots.</p>

<p>The wear on these felt faced renovators was found to be so
rapid that hard felt or composition rubber strips, placed so
that the wear comes on the edges of the same, have been substituted.
The felt or rubber was screwed on to the outside of
a metal shell and projected sufficiently below the face of the
metal to permit considerable wearing off of same before the
surface of the metal came in contact with the surface cleaned.
When this occurs, the felt strips can readily be replaced with
new ones. The ends are left open about ¹⁄₂ in. to form an
inrush for the entering air. Such a type is shown in <a href="#Fig29">Fig. 29</a>.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>This renovator, in either of the above-described forms, is a
great improvement over the bristle brush in that the air passing<span class="pagenum" id="Page59">[59]</span>
into the body of the renovator must come into intimate contact
with the surfaces cleaned, but it still has the disadvantage of
tending to push the dirt before it.</p>

<p>A modification of the above-described renovators has been
introduced, in which the wearing surface of the renovator,
which is covered with felt, is rounded as shown in <a href="#Fig30">Fig. 30</a>.
With this form of bare floor renovator, the air passing into
same is not only brought into intimate contact with the surface
cleaned but the dust is also crowded under the curved
surface of the renovator as the same is pushed over the floor
and thus brought directly into the path of the air current.</p>

<div class="container w30emmax" id="Fig30">

<img src="images/illo059.jpg" alt="">

<p class="caption">FIG. 30. BARE FLOOR RENOVATOR WITH ROUNDED WEARING
SURFACE.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The last named type is by far the most effective for cleaning
either polished or unpolished floors. It must be provided,
however, with inrush slots in order to prevent its sticking and
preventing easy operation. When operated with hose pipe and
a vacuum producer necessary to produce 2 in. of vacuum in
Type A carpet renovators, at least 30 cu. ft. of air must be
permitted to pass the renovator. When operated with systems
adapted to produce 4¹⁄₂ in. of vacuum in Type A carpet renovators,
at least 70 cu. ft. of air must pass the renovator in
order to permit easy operation.</p>

<p>This increase in the air quantity without change in the degree
of vacuum in the case of these renovators, is not without
increase in efficiency, as in the case of the carpet renovators,
because large quantities of dust and also small litter are met
with much more frequently on bare floors than on carpets.
With the increase in the volume of air passing, it is possible
to pick up much heavier articles than with the smaller quantity.
It is also possible to pull dust out of deep cracks or<span class="pagenum" id="Page60">[60]</span>
from surfaces which are not in contact with the renovator face,
such as the spaces between the slats of floors of trolley cars.
This would not be possible with the small air quantity. The
use of the larger quantity of air prohibits the use of small-sized
hose and pipe and, therefore, larger articles can be conveyed
through them. Where a large amount of bare floor must
be rapidly cleaned the use of the larger air quantity is recommended.</p>

<p class="caption">FIG. 30a. THE TUEC SCHOOL TOOL.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>A renovator (<a href="#Fig30a">Fig. 30a</a>) of unusual interest has recently been
developed by The United Electric Company, known as the Tuec
school tool. This is a bare floor tool open at both ends. It is
made telescopic and is mounted on three wheels fitted with
spring-actuated guide rails which are adjustable to the exact
distance between the legs of school desks. A turbine motor,
operated by the air passing through the renovator, is arranged
to drive two of the wheels by means of worm gear and clutch.</p>

<p>In operation the tool is placed opposite the front of a row
of desks. The clutch engaged on the turbine propels the tool
through the space between the desk legs to the rear of the
room. When the tool strikes the wall at the rear of the room,
the clutch is disengaged and it is pulled back by drawing in the
hose. The spring-actuated guides cause the cleaning slot to
lengthen when passing between the desk legs thereby cleaning
these spaces. The tool is then sent up the aisle, the wheels
being set so that it hugs the left side of the aisle when going
up and the right side when pulled back. The use of this form
of tool should result in considerable saving of time in cleaning
school rooms. Unfortunately, it cannot be operated where
pedestal stools are used.</p>

<p>For use in cleaning walls, ceilings, and other flat surfaces of
similar character, the bristle brush is practically the only form
of renovator used.</p>

<p>Rubber skirting cannot be used on these brushes as it is too
harsh for the easily-marred surfaces encountered by this renovator,
and cotton flannel or a very soft grade of felt takes the
place thereof. This change in the material used for skirting
results in a greater short-circuiting of the air into the cleaner
without coming into intimate contact with the surface cleaned
than occurs when used with rubber or hard felt on bare floors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page61">[61]</span></p>

<p>As the material to be removed from surfaces of this character
is very light dust, which has simply settled on the surface
and is not ground in, it is very easy to dislodge. When a
bristle brush, with a small volume of air passing through same,
is used to remove this material, a greater portion thereof is
pushed off the projections and other points of lodgment and
falls to the floor from whence it must be removed by a second
operation, using a floor renovator. In fact, the use of an ordinary
bristle brush, followed by the use of a floor renovator, will
give almost as good results as the use of a bristle wall brush
with a small quantity of air passing. However, with a large
quantity of air passing into the renovator, this light surface
dust will all be picked up by the rapidly-moving air current and
effective cleaning can be accomplished without the renovator
coming into direct contact with the surface to be cleaned.</p>

<p>The author considers that a different form of renovator is
necessary to effectively clean walls, ceilings and similar flat
surfaces, with a small quantity of air passing and would recommend
the use of some form of renovator having a cleaning face
composed of cotton flannel or some other soft substance which
could be moved over the surface cleaned, in intimate contact
therewith and without damage thereto. With the soft, open
fibre of the substance necessary to be used as a working surface,
sufficient air would enter the renovator without resorting to the
use of inrush slots or openings and much better results would
be obtained. No such renovator has been designed for this
purpose to date, for what reason the author does not know,
and until some such renovator is produced a large volume of
air will be necessary for cleaning this kind of surfaces.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>An illustration of this defect in the wall brush was brought
to the author’s attention recently in watching a gang of laborers
cleaning the walls in the U. S. Treasury Building. They
had at their disposal a portable cleaner of the most efficient
type, but in lieu of using the wall brush provided with same,
they were rubbing off the walls with a cloth mop which had
been soaked in oil, then air-dried, known as the “dustless
duster.” This was mounted on the end of a pole. The workmen
frequently cleaned this duster with the vacuum cleaner
hose without any renovator attached thereto. This cleaner,<span class="pagenum" id="Page62">[62]</span>
with brush in use, passed approximately 30 cu. ft. of free
air per minute. It is evident that these laborers had learned
by experience that it was practically useless to try to remove
dust from the walls by the direct application of the wall brush
to surfaces and were undoubtedly accomplishing much better
results in the roundabout way they had of necessity adopted.</p>

<p>When carved or other relief work is encountered, the round
bristle brush, with extra long bristles and cotton flannel skirting,
is nearly universally used. This type of renovator is
shown in <a href="#Fig31">Fig. 31</a>.</p>

<p>Owing to the irregularity of such surfaces, intimate contact
therewith cannot be obtained and practically no results will be
had unless there is a large quantity of air passing through
the renovator. When a large quantity of air is available,
nearly as good results in cleaning this character of surface
can be obtained by the use of the straight rubber-tipped
corner cleaner, with a round opening about ³⁄₄ in. in diameter,
as illustrated in <a href="#Fig32">Fig. 32</a>. A very high velocity will be obtained
through this renovator which will pull the dust out of inaccessible
places. This form of cleaner is also very effective for
cleaning the corners of rooms, where the floor and walls intersect,<span class="pagenum" id="Page63">[63]</span>
veritable dust catchers that they are, the cleaning of which
is fully as important as it is difficult. Pigeon holes and other
small compartments in safes, desks and similar furniture can
be easily cleaned with this little renovator by simply introducing
it into the front of such compartment.</p>

<p>To be effective, this renovator must pass approximately 55
cu. ft. of air per minute and will require a vacuum within the
renovator of approximately 3¹⁄₂ in. of mercury. Where only
a small quantity of air is available, the author considers that
it is better to make use of compressed air to blow the dust out
of relief work, pigeon holes, and other inaccessible places and
subsequently pick this dust up with other forms of renovators
after it has found lodgment at more accessible points.</p>

<p>The cleaner which has met with the most disastrous results
to the surfaces cleaned is the furniture or upholstery renovator.
This has nearly always taken the form of a small carpet renovator.
The type of upholstery renovator used for many years
by the Sanitary Devices Manufacturing Company is illustrated
in <a href="#Fig33">Fig. 33</a>. This renovator had an inrush slot in the center,
separated from a cleaning slot on each side by a partition extending
to within ¹⁄₃₂ in. of the working face of the renovator.
It had the hose connected into one end which was extended
to form a handle. With this cleaning tool it was
considered impossible to obtain a high vacuum within the renovator,
as the inrush slots were supposed to act as vacuum
breakers. However, as the surface of the upholstery is not
firmly attached to the furniture it could be drawn up into the
cleaner, closing the space under the partitions and permitting
a high vacuum to be obtained. This caused the renovator to<span class="pagenum" id="Page64">[64]</span>
stick, but, owing to the narrow slot on each side of the inrush,
the fabric was not caught.</p>

<p>Other manufacturers used a renovator with a single slot, in
some cases as wide as ¹⁄₄ in., and instances are on record where
the coverings of the furniture have been drawn up through the
cleaning slot into the renovator and wedged so tightly that it
was necessary to cut the covering from the furniture in order
to release the renovator. To overcome this difficulty one manufacturer
constructed the renovator in two pieces, secured together
with screws, so that, in case the renovator became caught,
it could be taken apart to release the fabric.</p>

<p>Many manufacturers have attempted to overcome this destructive
tendency of the straight-slot upholstery renovator by
inserting partitions on the cleaning face of the renovator, thus
dividing the cleaning slot into a number of small slots the area
of each not being sufficiently large to permit the drawing in of
the fabric. These cleaners have followed two general forms,
one having narrow slots running lengthwise of the cleaner, as
illustrated in <a href="#Fig34">Fig. 34</a>. This form reduces the destructive tendency
to a great extent, but does not entirely prevent drawing
the fabric into the renovator. If the partitions across the renovator
be continuous, as indicated by the sketch, there will be
a portion of the renovator which will not do any cleaning.
Another form uses short slots, sufficiently inclined for the top
of one slot to overlap the bottom of its neighbor, as shown in
<a href="#Fig35">Fig. 35</a>. This form of renovator is effective throughout its
entire length and the small area of each slot makes it practically
impossible to draw the fabric into the cleaning slot. It is considered
by the author to be superior to the former type,
especially when cleaning lace curtains or silk hangings or any
other very light fabric.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>However, if the exhauster be of such characteristics and the
hose and pipe lines be so proportioned that there is practically<span class="pagenum" id="Page65">[65]</span>
a constant vacuum in the renovator, regardless of the quantity
of air passing, and provided this vacuum is not allowed to exceed
5 or 6 in. of mercury, no disastrous effects will be experienced
in cleaning light-weight fabrics with a straight-slot
renovator having a cleaning slot not over ¹⁄₄ in. wide. The
use of this type, in connection with a system having the above-described
characteristics, is recommended whenever rapid cleaning
is desired.</p>

<p>Upholstery renovators make the most serviceable clothing
cleaners, while a small type of bristle brush, not over 4 in. long
and not over ³⁄₄ in. wide, makes the most serviceable hat brush.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>An important form of renovator is that used for cleaning between
the sections and behind heating radiators. A piece of
tubing, flattened at its outer end, is by far the most effective
device for this purpose. This renovator, in connection with
the hat brush tool, makes the two best renovators for use in the
library, effective cleaning being possible with not more than
20 cu. ft. of air per minute, but much faster work can be done
with larger quantities.</p>

<img src="images/illo065b.jpg" alt="">

<p class="caption">FIG. 36. HAND BRUSH TYPE OF RENOVATOR.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>Another form of renovator sometimes furnished is the small
hand brush. This is a bristle brush, approximately 8 in. long
and 2 in. wide, with the hose connection made into one end of
same, as illustrated in <a href="#Fig36">Fig. 36</a>. This renovator is useful for
cleaning wooden furniture, shelves, tables, and other horizontal
surfaces at about hand height, but, owing to the tendency of
the air to short circuit in its way to the body of the renovator,
it will not do effective work with small quantities of air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page66">[66]</span></p>

<p>Many manufacturers have produced a special renovator for
cleaning stairs. This has nearly always taken the form of a
bristle brush, approximately 4 in. square. When renovators
are rigidly attached to their stems, this form of renovator is
convenient and almost a necessity. However, when swivel joints
are provided, the ordinary carpet or bare floor renovators are
fully as convenient, and, being larger, are more rapid cleaners,
and the stair renovator is unnecessary.</p>

<p>In isolated cases, where unusual cleaning is necessary, such
as the removal of cork dust from the floors of a cork factory,
picking up telegraph forms from the floors of stock exchanges,
picking up wrapping papers in watch factories, etc., special
forms of renovators, with large openings and large capacities
for air exhaustion, become necessary. These appliances have
generally taken the form similar to the carpet renovator, but
with much wider slots, the forward edges of which are raised
slightly above the surface of the floor when the renovator is in
operation. These renovators, being of no use for any other
purpose than that for which they are specially designed, and
requiring quantities of air in excess of those usually provided
for ordinary types of renovators, may be considered simply as
special appliances and do not form a part of the outfit required
to be furnished with an ordinary cleaning system.</p>

<p>Another class of cleaning which requires a special system and
special appliances is the renovation of furs. Furs must never
be brushed, as it tends to mat the hair and produce an effect
opposite to renovation. The only agent suitable for renovating
furs is compressed air and the form of renovator best suited
for this work is a straight nozzle, flattened at the end with a
slot approximately 4 in. long and not over ¹⁄₃₂ in. wide, from
which the air escapes in a thin sheet. When held at such an
angle that the air will impinge on the skin under the hair, a
thorough renovation of the fur is possible.</p>

<p>For the renovation of pillows a hollow needle, with small
openings along its sides, supplied with compressed air, produces
the best results. The needle is thrust through the cover into
the mass of feathers, the air tending to loosen up the matted
feathers and to leave them in practically the same condition as
when the pillow was first filled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page67">[67]</span></p>

<p>As the arrangement of the air removal system, to permit it
being reversed from exhaustion to compression, complicates the
outfit and adds to its first cost, and as cleaning of this character
is required only at rare intervals, these renovators may
also be considered as special and need not be included in the
average equipment.</p>

<p id="Ref01">The author considers that the renovator equipment for a system
in which from 20 to 30 cu. ft. of air per minute is exhausted
for each renovator in operation, and which the author
classes as a “small volume” system, should contain the following
renovators in each “set” furnished:</p>

<p>One carpet renovator with cleaning slot ¹⁄₄ in. by 12 in. long.</p>

<p>One bare floor renovator 12 in. long, with curved felt-covered
face.</p>

<p>One wall renovator 12 in. long, with cotton flannel and
curved face.</p>

<p>One upholstery renovator with slot ¹⁄₄ in. by 4 in.</p>

<p>One corner cleaner.</p>

<p>One radiator cleaner.</p>

<p>In addition, one or more hat brushes should be included
with each installation.</p>

<p id="Ref02">The renovator equipment for a system in which 70 cu. ft.
of air per minute is exhausted for each renovator in operation,
which the author classes as a “large volume” system, should
contain the following renovators in each “set” furnished:</p>

<p>One carpet renovator, with slot ¹⁄₄ in. by 15 in.</p>

<p>One bare floor renovator 15 in. long, with curved felt-covered
face.</p>

<p>One wall brush, with skirted bristles 12 in. long and 2 in.

<p>One hand brush, with hose connection at end, 8 in. long
and 2 in. wide.</p>

<p>One 4-in. round brush for relief work.</p>

<p>One upholstery renovator.</p>

<p>One corner cleaner.</p>

<p>One radiator tool.</p>

<p>At least one hat brush with each system.</p>

<p>The number of sets of renovators to be furnished should
naturally be at least equal to the number of sweepers which<span class="pagenum" id="Page68">[68]</span>
the plant will handle, and in all buildings, except residences,
there should be one set of renovators for each floor of the
building. This will be ample, except in exceedingly large
buildings.</p>

<p>The wearing face of any renovator should never be made of
soft metal, such as brass or aluminum, as the action of the
dust passing the face of the renovator, where the velocity is
always the highest in the system, will roughen these parts
and cause undue wear on the surfaces cleaned. Stamped steel
is undoubtedly the best material for wearing surface and cast-iron
ranks next. These are the only materials which should
be permitted.</p>

<p>Having discussed the various forms of renovators in detail,
the next appliance to be taken up is the connection between
the renovator and the cleaning hose, this being the next portion
of the apparatus forming a conduit for the dust-laden air
on its way from the renovator to the atmosphere on the exhaust
side of the vacuum producer.</p>

<p>In order that the renovator may be moved about on the
surfaces to be cleaned, a rigid handle must be provided and,
in order that these various surfaces may be reached while the
operator remains in a standing position, it is necessary that
this handle be of considerable, as well as variable, length. Also,
a passage for the dust-laden air must be provided in connection
with this handle. These conditions are best met by a metal
tube, which the author terms the stem.</p>

<p>These stems have been made of various metals, that first used
being drawn brass, probably because it is best suited to be
nickel plated. On the earlier systems they were almost invariably
made of No. 16-gauge tubing, ⁷⁄₈-in. outside diameter,
and were bent at their upper end through an angle of nearly
135° in order that the hose would hang from the stem vertically
downward, when the stem was held at an angle with the floor
of 45°.</p>

<p>The lower ends of these stems were rigidly attached to the
renovator in such a manner as to assume the above-mentioned
angle with the floor when the renovator was in the proper
position for cleaning. In order to bring the curved portion of
the stem hand high, the stem was made approximately 5 ft.
long.</p>

<p>When operated with Type A carpet renovators, these curved
stems were apparently satisfactory. However, when they were
used in department stores, and other places where much bare<span class="pagenum" id="Page70">[70]</span>
floor cleaning was necessary, the stems were cut through at
the curved portion by the sand blast action of the dust. The
cutting of these stems in bare floor work, while they were satisfactory
in carpet cleaning, indicates that the velocity in the
stem, due to the large volume of air passing the bare floor
renovator, was too great for this soft metal to withstand the
impact of the dust on the curved surface. With the systems
in use at that time no means were provided to control the
vacuum at the vacuum producer and the hose and pipe lines
were small, both of which tended to cause a wide variation in
the volume of air exhausted under various conditions, in
the character of surface cleaned, and in the number of renovators
in use. Therefore, the value of this destructive velocity
is not readily obtainable. However, the author considers that,
in extreme cases, the quantity of air passing through these
stems may have been as high as 55 cu. ft. per minute. As the
inside diameter of the stems was ³⁄₄ in. the area was 0.44 sq. in.,
or 0.00328 sq. ft., and the velocity through the stem was nearly
17,000 ft. per minute. With an average air passage of 40 cu.
ft. per minute the velocity was 12,200 ft. per minute.</p>

<p>Referring to tests of carpet renovators, <a href="#Page25">Chapter III</a>, it will
be noted that the maximum volume of air passing through
carpet renovators of Type A was 33 cu. ft. per minute, which
gives a velocity of 10,000 ft. per minute. Apparently, at this
velocity, the cutting action, due to the impact of the dust on
the curved surfaces, was not severe. However, the author considers
that the maximum velocity that should be permitted
through these stems is 9,000 ft. per minute.</p>

<p>As the dirt picked up must be lifted almost vertically, the
velocity in the stem must not become too low or dirt will lodge
in the stem. Experiments made by the author indicate that
the minimum velocity should be at least 4,000 ft. per minute,
in order to insure a clean stem at all times.</p>

<p>Shortly after the introduction of vacuum cleaning, the use
of drawn-steel tubing for the manufacture of stems for cleaning
tools was standard with one manufacturer and, lately, its
use has become almost universal, except in cases where very
long stems are necessary, as on wall brushes when cleaning<span class="pagenum" id="Page71">[71]</span>
very high ceilings. For such work, aluminum stems have been
adopted.</p>

<p>This harder metal will better withstand the cutting action
of the dust and can also be made much thinner and lighter in
weight than brass tubing of equal strength. These stems were
made from 1 in. outside diameter, No. 21 gauge tubing, having
an internal area of 0.68 sq. in., and the author does not know
of any cases where these stems have been cut by the impact
of the dust.</p>

<p>Stems of this metal are recommended by the author for use
with all floor renovators and with wall brushes, except in
cases where exceedingly long stems are required, when those
of drawn aluminum tubing are recommended.</p>

<p>For use with Type A renovators, where the minimum air
quantity is approximately 22 cu. ft. per minute, the greatest
area permissible is
<span class="horsplit"><span class="topsplit">22</span><span class="botsplit">4000</span></span>
= 0.0055 sq. ft., or 0.79 sq. in., equivalent
to 1-in. diameter. With a maximum air quantity, under
proper control, of 39 cu. ft. per minute, the minimum area
will be
<span class="horsplit"><span class="topsplit">39</span><span class="botsplit">9000</span></span>
= 0.00433 sq. ft. or 0.625 sq. in., equivalent to
0.89 in. diameter, so that a 1-in. outside diameter stem of No.
21 gauge metal, having an inside diameter of 0.932 in., is
recommended.</p>

<p>For use with a Type F renovator, with a minimum air quantity
of 44 cu. ft. per minute, the maximum area of the stem
will be
<span class="horsplit"><span class="topsplit">44</span><span class="botsplit">4000</span></span>
= 0.011 sq. ft., or 1.58 sq. in., equivalent to 1.4
in. diameter, while, with a maximum air quantity of 70 cu. ft.
per minute, the minimum area will be
<span class="horsplit"><span class="topsplit">70</span><span class="botsplit">9000</span></span>
= 0.0077 sq. ft.,
or 1.11 sq. in., equivalent to 1.18 in. diameter, and a 1¹⁄₄-in.
diameter stem of No. 21 gauge metal, having an inside diameter
of 1.18 in. is recommended.</p>

<p>Tests of Mr. S. A. Reeve, which are discussed in <a href="#Page25">Chapter
III</a>, indicate that both edges of the cleaning slot on any renovator
must be in contact with the surface cleaned in order to
do effective cleaning. A renovator which is rigidly connected
to its stem can be effectively operated with the stem at but
one angle with the surface cleaned, which makes the cleaning
under furniture, or on wall at various heights above the floor,
impossible. In order to do effective cleaning with any degree<span class="pagenum" id="Page72">[72]</span>
of speed and comfort to the operator, some form of swivel joint
between the renovator and its stem is necessary.</p>

<p>These swivels have been made in many forms, one of which
consists of two hemispheres connected by a bolt on their axis,
as shown in <a href="#Fig37">Fig. 37</a>. This form of swivel is unsuited for use
under these conditions, as lint, thread and any other small
articles picked up will catch on the bolt which lies directly
in the path of the dust-laden air current, and its use should
be prohibited in all cases.</p>

<p class="caption">FIG. 37. FORM OF SWIVEL JOINT CONNECTING STEM TO
RENOVATOR.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>Another form of swivel, which is must better than the last
mentioned, is shown in the illustration of the bare floor brush,
<a href="#Fig26">Fig. 26</a>, Chapter IV, there being no obstruction in the air
passage. However, these swivels are composed of moving parts
which are in contact with the dust-laden air and great care
must be taken in their design so that in action dust does not
lodge between the wearing surfaces and shortly ruin the swivel.
This can be guarded against by making any opening between
the parts of the swivel point away from the dust current, as
indicated in <a href="#Fig38">Fig. 38</a>, in which the direction of the air current
is indicated by the arrow. A slightly loose fit between the
wearing surfaces will permit a small leakage of air through the
joint which will tend to remove any dust which may find its
way into the joint. However, it is not considered advisable
either to allow very much leakage through the joint, as it reduces
the net efficiency of the system, or to depend much on<span class="pagenum" id="Page73">[73]</span>
the air current through the joint keeping the wearing surfaces
clean. The swivel indicated in the illustration of the
floor brush does not entirely prevent the dust entering same
and it permits the movement of the stem in a vertical plane
only. On the other hand, a swivel consisting of a 45° elbow,
rigidly attached to the stem and turning freely on a horizontal
spud, and fastened to the renovator, as shown in <a href="#Fig38">Fig. 38</a>, allows
a motion of the stem either in a vertical plane, which will cause
the renovator to rotate, and enable the operator to pass same
around or back of legs of furniture, or a semi-rotary motion
may be imparted to the stem, which will permit the renovator
to move forward in a straight line while the angle which the
stem makes with the floor will constantly decrease. After a
little practice the operator can place a renovator equipped with
one of these swivels in almost any position without inconvenience.
Illustrations of the possibilities of this form of
swivel are presented in <a href="#Fig39">Figs. 39</a> and <a href="#Fig40">40</a>, in which an operator is
shown cleaning the treads and risers of a stairway without
changing her position, and in <a href="#Fig41">Fig. 41</a>, where the operator is
cleaning the trim of a door with apparent ease. The author
considers that this form of swivel is the only satisfactory joint
between the renovator and its stem. It is being rapidly
adopted by nearly every manufacturer of vacuum cleaners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page74">[74]</span></p>

<p>In operating any renovator it is nearly always drawn backwards
and forwards in front of the operator, across the surface
to be cleaned. When the hose is rigidly attached to the upper
end of the stem, it becomes necessary to drag at least a portion
of the cleaning hose along with the renovator when it is
moved forward, and to crowd the same back on itself when
the renovator is moved backward. This action has a tendency
to kink or snarl the hose about itself and makes the operation
of the renovator very awkward, often causing the operator’s
feet to become entangled in the hose.</p>

<div class="container w35emmax" id="Fig39">

<img src="images/illo074.jpg" alt="">

<p class="caption">FIG. 39. SWIVEL JOINT IN USE.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>This action also brings an undue amount of wear on the
hose near the end which is attached to the stem, as may be
readily noted by inspection of hose used with rigidly-attached
stems. This will show that the end of the hose is entirely worn
through, while the remainder of the hose is still in serviceable
condition.</p>

<p>The trouble above stated can be overcome by providing a
swivel joint at the point of connection between the hose and<span class="pagenum" id="Page75">[75]</span>
the stem. A few attempts to use a joint similar to that first
described in connection with the renovator and its stem, as
illustrated in <a href="#Fig37">Fig. 37</a>, have been made, but without much success,
as the bolt through the air passage catches dirt and there
is not sufficient freedom of movement between the portions of
the swivel. Variations of this form of joint have been made,
one of which is provided with a screwed union to join the two
portions, as shown in <a href="#Fig42">Fig. 42</a>. This is a much better form than
that first described and has been successfully used in connection
with heavy 1-in. diameter hose. Care must be exercised
that the direction of the flow of air is always in the direction
indicated by the arrows in the sketches, as a reversal, if only
for a short time, will ruin the joint, due to lodgment of dust
in the moving parts.</p>

<p>Still another variation in this form of swivel has the two
main parts made to fit one within the other and a snap ring is<span class="pagenum" id="Page76">[76]</span>
placed in a groove in the male portion of the joint, this groove
being deep enough to take the entire thickness of the ring.
The two parts are then fitted together and the ring snaps out
into a corresponding groove in the female portion of the joint,
uniting the two parts. This joint gives a fairly free movement
to the parts thereof, but has the disadvantage that it cannot be
taken apart without breaking one of its parts.</p>

<p class="allclear">A modification of this form of swivel has been made by the

are forced into this groove, after the parts are assembled,
through an opening provided in the edges of the parts. This
opening is closed, after the balls are in place, by a small pin,
as shown in <a href="#Fig43">Fig. 43</a>. The swivel then becomes a ball-bearing
joint, with a freedom of motion characteristic of such bearings.
This joint readily responds to every movement of the stem and
keeps the hose hanging vertically downward and always free
from kinks. Its action is illustrated in <a href="#Fig44">Fig. 44</a>, in which it
is being used in connection with a carpet renovator. This
joint is considered to be the most efficient on the market. It
is protected by a patent controlled by a manufacturer of
vacuum cleaners.</p>

<p>Valves are placed at the upper end of the stems by many
manufacturers, to cut off the suction when carrying the renovators
from room to room, and when it is necessary to stop
sweeping to move furniture. These valves have nearly always
taken the form of a plug cock with tee or knurled handle. They
are useful on large installations, where vacuum control is either
inherent in the exhauster or where some means of vacuum control
is provided, as a considerable saving of power may be
obtained by closing same, as will be explained in a later chapter,
and to overcome the unpleasant hissing noise caused by the
inrush of air into the renovator when same is held off the
floor.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>When the exhauster has a capacity of but one sweeper and
when the cleaning is done at times when the building is unoccupied,
there seems to be little need for this refinement, which
has two defects: first, the operators will not close the valves:
second, when they have been closed they are only partly opened,
as indicated in <a href="#Fig45">Fig. 45</a>. When this occurs, the portions of the
plug, which are shown stippled, are quickly cut away by the
sand-blast action of the dust, making it necessary to open the
valve a still smaller amount the next time it is operated, cutting
off still more of the plug until a new plug is necessary in order
to make the valve again operative.</p>

<p>A few attempts have been made to overcome these defects
by making the valves self-closing and having them so constructed
that when the operator grasps the handle the valve
will be forced wide open, on the principle of the pistol grip.
These valves will, of course, close whenever the handle is released,
and it is impossible to grasp the handle in any degree<span class="pagenum" id="Page79">[79]</span>
of comfort without throwing the valve wide open. However,
since the valve is closed by a spring, considerable pressure must
be applied to the handle in order to keep it open and it acts
similar to the Sandow dumb bell in producing fatigue of the
fingers in a short time; they have not come into general use.
The use of valves in the renovator handle is considered by the
author to be an expense not justified by the gain in economy
and they are no longer included in specifications prepared
by him.</p>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>The more important steps in the evolution of the modern
vacuum cleaning system can each be attributed to a change in
the design or construction of some one of its component parts,
which, in their former standard design, have acted as a limiting
factor governing the form and size of other and more important
parts of the system.</p>

<p>That part of the early systems which played the most important
role as a limiting factor was one for whose production
the builder of the system had to look to other manufacturers:
namely, the flexible hose connecting the renovator stem to the
rigid pipe lines and vacuum producer.</p>

<p>The early builders of vacuum cleaning systems naturally
adopted a standard article for use as a flexible conduit; that
is, the vacuum hose which had been used as suction lines for
pumps of various characters. For such use it was not necessary
that the hose be moved about to any great extent and, therefore,
its weight was not an important factor and had been
sacrificed to strength to withstand collapse and the rough handling
to which suction hose is subject.</p>

<p>This standard hose was built up of many layers of canvas
wound around a rubber tube or lining. A spiral wire was imbedded
between the layers of canvas to prevent collapse and
the whole was provided with an outer covering of rubber.
Generally five to seven layers of canvas were used and the
resulting hose was not highly flexible.</p>

<p>When used as a flexible conduit in connection with a vacuum
cleaning system it became necessary to constantly move the
hose back and forth and around the room to be cleaned. It was
also necessary to limit the weight of the hose to that which
could be easily handled by one person. This led to the adoption
of small sizes of the then standard hose, ³⁄₄-in. diameter
being first used, but soon this was abandoned in favor of 1-in.
diameter hose weighing nearly 1 lb. per foot of length, which
is the maximum weight that can be conveniently handled by<span class="pagenum" id="Page81">[81]</span>
one person. This size hose has become the standard for all
systems maintaining a vacuum at the separators of 10 in. of
mercury or more.</p>

<p>Owing to its lack of flexibility this type of hose is easily
kinked and is damaged by the pulling out of such kinks, causing
the tubing or lining to become separated from the canvas
and to collapse, rendering the hose useless. There is also considerable
wear at the point of connection to the stems of
renovators, where rigid connections are used.</p>

<p>The outside of this hose, being rubber, is always liberally
covered with soap-stone when it leaves the manufacturer, and
when new hose is dragged about over carpets, it frequently soils
same to a greater degree than they are cleaned by the renovator.
When this hose has been in use about twice as long
as is necessary to wear off the soap-stone, its appearance
becomes far from handsome and is not considered to be in
keeping with the nickel-plated appliances which are furnished
with the cleaning tools. To overcome this objection, an outer
braid has been applied generally over the rubber coating, thus
adding further to its already great weight.</p>

<p>What was perhaps the first type of hose to be produced
especially for use with vacuum cleaning systems was that in
which the fabric was woven in layers, instead of being wrapped
spirally around the central tube or lining. Steam was introduced
into the lining, vulcanizing the lining and firmly uniting
the whole mass. This hose was made 1 in. in diameter, without
any metal re-inforcement, and was covered with the usual rubber
coating and with braid, when ordered. This hose weighed
12 oz. per lineal foot and 1-in. diameter was still the largest
that could be easily handled.</p>

<p>The first attempt to produce a light-weight hose for use
with vacuum cleaning systems was by covering a spiral steel
tape with canvas. The air leakage through this hose was found
to be so high that its use resulted in loss of efficiency of the
cleaning plant and it was found necessary to line the hose with
rubber. This rubber-lined hose is made in larger sizes than
formerly used and 2-in. diameter hose weighs approximately
14 oz. per lineal foot. It is also much more flexible than the
1-in. hose formerly used.</p>

<p>The introduction of this type made it possible to use larger<span class="pagenum" id="Page82">[82]</span>
hose in connection with vacuum cleaning systems and permitted
the use of a lower vacuum at the separators, with the same
results at the carpet renovator, and a larger quantity of air
when using the brushes and other renovators. Without this
type of hose the low-vacuum, large-volume systems would be
impractical.</p>

<p>Another type of hose has been recently introduced in which
a wire is woven into the fabric of the hose and the rubber
lining vulcanized into place as already described. No outer
coating of rubber is used and, therefore, no braid is necessary.
This gives a light-weight hose of great flexibility and neat appearance
and is undoubtedly the best hose for residence work.
It is more costly than the steel tape hose which is recommended
for office building and factory use, where appearance is not
important.</p>

<p class="caption">FIG. 46. BAYONET TYPE OF HOSE COUPLING, INTRODUCED BY
THE AMERICAN AIR CLEANING COMPANY.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<h3 class="inline"><b>Hose Couplings.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">—The earlier systems used couplings having
screw-threaded ground joints, similar to those which were then
in use on hose intended to withstand pressure. These couplings
require considerable time to connect and disconnect and the
threads are easily damaged by dragging the hose about. The
exposed metal parts of the couplings are liable to scratch furniture.</p>

<p>To overcome the time required to connect and disconnect the
screw-coupling, the American Air Cleaning Company introduced
the bayonet type of coupling, as illustrated in <a href="#Fig46">Fig. 46</a>.
This coupling is not readily damaged by rough handling, but it
has metal surfaces exposed which will scratch furniture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page83">[83]</span></p>

<p>Both of these couplings have the disadvantage that the
air current in the hose must always be in the same direction
and the same end of the hose must always be next to the
renovator handle. Both of these features tend to increase the
wear on the hose, and the reversal of the air current to remove
stoppages is not possible.</p>

<p>The coupling produced by the Sanitary Devices Manufacturing
Company has a piece of steel tubing fitted into each end
of the hose and secured by means of a brass slip-coupler fitting
over the tubing. All ends being alike, the reversal of the hose
is possible with this form of coupling. However, the metal
coupler is liable to mar furniture and sometimes there is trouble
with the couplings pulling apart.</p>

<div class="container w50emmax" id="Fig47">

<img src="images/illo083.jpg" alt="">

<p class="caption">FIG. 47. ALL RUBBER HOSE COUPLING USED BY THE SPENCER
TURBINE CLEANER COMPANY.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>Much of the hose in use today is provided with “pure gum”
ends are vulcanized in place, it is necessary to take the hose
of metal tubing is slipped inside of these ends to make a coupling.
With this arrangement there is no metal exposed to mar
furniture and the hose lengths are reversible. However, there
is some trouble from the couplings pulling apart. Since these
ends are vulcanized in place, it is necessary to take the hose
to a rubber repair shop whenever the hose breaks back of the
coupling, which occurs frequently when rigidly attached to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page84">[84]</span>
stem of the renovator. These repair shops are much more
numerous than a few years ago and this drawback is not a
serious one.</p>

<p>Another form of coupling used by the Spencer Turbine
Cleaner Company is the all-rubber male and female end, as
illustrated in <a href="#Fig47">Fig. 47</a>. This has the advantage over the metal-slip
couplings and the coupling with pure gum ends in that
when it is properly locked it cannot be pulled apart. It is
absolutely air tight, which is true of no other coupling. But
it does not permit the reversal of the hose and is, therefore,
recommended for use only with hose of 1¹⁄₄-in. diameter or
larger, where there is less liability of stoppage, and where the
ball-bearing swivel is used at the connection to the stem, preventing
excessive wear at this point. The pure gum ends,
with the internal-slip coupler, is considered to be the most
satisfactory for use in all cases, except as above stated.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Hose Friction.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">—Hose friction plays an important part in the
action of any vacuum cleaning system. In fact, where 1-in.
hose is used, it becomes a limiting factor in the capacity of
the system to perform some kinds of cleaning.</p>

<p>There are several tables of hose friction published by the
manufacturers of vacuum cleaning systems, all of which appear
to have been based on a constant velocity within the hose equal
to that which would be obtained if the air were at atmospheric
pressure throughout the entire length of the hose. But in
practice the air is admitted to the hose from the renovator at
a considerably lower absolute pressure of from 25 in. to
27 in. of mercury, and is, therefore, moving at a higher
velocity. As the pressure is decreased by the friction loss in
the hose, the velocity constantly increases with the expansion
of the air.</p>

<p>The results of many tests made by the author during the
past seven years, with hose ranging from 1-in. to 2-in. diameter
and with an entering vacuum ranging from 0 to 7 in. of mercury
and a friction loss of from 1 in. to 25 in. of mercury,
indicate a close agreement with the formula given in
Prof. William Kent’s “Mechanical Engineer’s Pocketbook,”
which is based on the formula:</p>

<p class="formula">Q = c <span class="radical2">√</span>
<span class="horsplit size100"><span class="topsplit bt">pd⁵</span><span class="botsplit">wL</span></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page85">[85]</span></p>

<p>To permit the rapid calculation of the air quantity which
can be passed through a hose, the author has prepared the
diagram shown in <a href="#Fig48">Fig. 48</a>. To use this table, look up the friction
loss in the hose in the right hand margin, pass along the
horizontal line to the left until it intersects the line inclined
at an angle of 45° toward the left, indicating the length of the
hose. From this intersection pass vertically to the line inclined
at approximately 30° toward the left, representing the
diameter of the hose. The quantity in the left-hand margin,
opposite the horizontal passing through this intersection, represents
the quantity of air which would pass through this hose
in cubic feet at the average density in the hose. To correct this
quantity to free air, step off the distance on the vertical line
from the bottom of the table, representing the average degree
of vacuum in the hose, to its intersection with the curved
line near the bottom of table. Transfer this distance vertically
downward on the left hand margin from the quantity first
read on this margin. The quantity opposite the lower end of
this distance will be the cubic feet of free air per minute passing
through the hose under these conditions.</p>

<p>The line inclined towards the right, which passes through the
intersection of lines representing hose diameter, and the horizontal
line representing the cubic feet of air passing through
the hose at actual density in same, shows the actual velocity
in the hose in feet per second.</p>

<p>For friction loss over 10 in. of mercury, use the figures
at the right hand of the lower margin, instead of those in the
right hand margin, and pass vertically to the hose diameter.<span class="pagenum" id="Page86">[86]</span>
Then proceed as before. As these high frictions are seldom
used in practice, this departure has been made in order to reduce
the size of the diagram.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page87">[87]</span></p>

<p>To illustrate how much the friction tables, based on air at
atmospheric density, vary from actual results, two tests made
by the author are given. In the first test it was desired to
pass 68 cu. ft. of free air per minute through a ⁷⁄₈-in. diameter
orifice at the end of 100 ft. of 1-in. diameter hose. Tests on
larger hose showed that, to permit this quantity of air to pass
through the orifice, a vacuum at the orifice of 2.6 in. mercury
was necessary. The most rational table the writer could find
indicated that the friction loss in the hose should be 18 in.
mercury, and the final vacuum necessary at the hose cock would
have to be 20.6 in. mercury. On test it was found that, with
24.8 in. vacuum at the hose cock, but 50 cu. ft. of free air per
minute was passing, with a vacuum at the orifice of 1.6 in.
mercury, showing a friction loss of 23.2 in. mercury. With the
smaller quantity of air passing, the same friction table indicated
a friction loss, with this quantity of air, of but 9.8 in. mercury,
or 39% of that actually observed. Checking the results of the
test with the diagram (<a href="#Fig48">Fig. 48</a>) gives 50 cu. ft. of free air,
with a friction loss of 23 in. mercury.</p>

<p>To illustrate more clearly the effect of the increase of velocity
on the friction loss, the actual vacuum in the hose has
been computed for each 10 ft. of its length and curves drawn
through these points. The results are shown in <a href="#Fig49">Fig. 49</a>. The
straight line indicates the vacuum which should exist were the
velocity in the hose constant throughout its length, and the
curved line shows the vacuum in the hose when the effect of
the increasing velocity, due to the rarefaction of the air, is considered.
The wide variation in the results shows clearly the
error in the former assumption of a constant velocity in the
hose throughout its length.</p>

<p>Another test, in which 44 cu. ft. of free air was passed
through 100 ft. of 1-in. diameter hose, is shown graphically in
<a href="#Fig50">Fig. 50</a>, which discloses that the assumption of a constant velocity
in the hose produces an error of 35% in the results, indicating
a loss of but 7.8 in., when the actual loss is 12 in. mercury.</p>

<p>Naturally, the lower the final vacuum at the hose cock, the
less will be the error due to the assumption of constant velocity
in the hose. Tests with 1¹⁄₂-in. hose gave results which agree<span class="pagenum" id="Page88">[88]</span>
substantially with the result given in tables already published,
and it was this condition that led to the discovery of the error
in the assumption stated.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Effect of Hose Friction.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">—As any increase in the degree of
vacuum necessary to be maintained at the vacuum producer
over that maintained within the renovator requires a greater
expenditure of power, without any increase in the efficiency
or speed of cleaning, it is essential that the friction loss in the
air conduit from the renovator to the vacuum producer should
be made as small as possible. The friction loss in the hose is
the greatest loss in any part of the system, being the smallest
in diameter, and its reduction to the lowest figure possible is
of vital importance.</p>

<p>Take, for example, the use of a Type A renovator with a
vacuum within the renovator of 4¹⁄₂ in. mercury and with 29
cu. ft. of air passing through same. The friction loss, with varying
lengths of different-sized hose, will be as follows:</p>

<p>This indicates, first, that a much lower friction loss will
result with the use of larger hose than is the case with the
smaller size. Note, also, that the difference in the final vacuum
at the hose cock is much more uniform when the larger-sized
hose is used in varying lengths. Since it is desired to maintain
a constant vacuum at the renovator at all times and it is
also desirable to be able to vary the length of hose to suit the
conditions of the work, while it is not convenient to vary the
vacuum at the hose cock, much more uniform results will be
possible when larger hose is used. If the smaller hose is used in
varying lengths and a practically uniform vacuum is maintained
at the hose cock, the quantity of air and the vacuum
at the renovator will vary. If 1-in. hose is used and the vacuum
at the hose cock be maintained at 10 in. mercury, the air quantities
and vacuum at the renovator will be approximately:</p>

<p>From this it is evident that the vacuum within the renovator
will be increased above that necessary for economical cleaning.
It will require somewhat more effort to push the cleaner over
the carpet and also a slightly greater expenditure of power at
the hose cock to operate the cleaner with a short than with a
long hose. However, the author does not consider that either
the increase of effort to push the renovator or the increase of
power will be sufficient to prohibit the use of 1-in. hose with
the Type A renovator.</p>

<p>Referring to <a href="#Fig17">Fig. 17</a>, Chapter III, it will be noted that Type
C renovator will not accomplish much in the way of cleaning
with a vacuum in the renovator lower than 4 in. mercury. Therefore,
if we use this type of renovator, with 1-in. diameter
hose, its length should be limited to 50 ft., for if we use a
vacuum higher than 10 in. at the hose cock, there will be too
much increase in the vacuum at the renovator when short hose
is used to allow easy operation, and if we use longer hose with
10-in. vacuum at the hose cock, there will be a reduction in the
vacuum at the renovator and effective cleaning cannot be accomplished.
Also, the power required at the hose cock to pass
44 cu. ft. of air, with a vacuum of 19 in. mercury, required to
produce a vacuum of 4 in. at the renovator with 100 ft. of 1-in.
hose, will be 3.3 H. P., which is prohibitive when compared with
that required with the use of larger hose, i. e., 0.825 H. P.
with 1¹⁄₄-in. hose and 0.59 H. P. with 1¹⁄₂-in. hose.</p>

<p>The Type F renovators tested by the author will show even
wider variations in the vacuum required at the hose cock with
the various lengths and diameters of hose than is given for
Type C renovator. However, the type F renovator, which is
now used by the Spencer Turbine Cleaner Company, having a
cleaning slot 15 in. long and ¹⁄₂ in. wide throughout its length.<span class="pagenum" id="Page92">[92]</span>
passes 44 cu. ft. of free air per minute, with a vacuum under
the renovator of 4 in. mercury and the resulting vacuum at the
hose cock will be the same as that given in the case of the Type
C renovator.</p>

<p>When a bare floor renovator of the bristle-brush type is attached
to the hose, the effect is practically the same as when
the end of the hose is left wide open, as the open character of
the brush prevents the formation of any vacuum in the renovator.
Therefore, sufficient air must pass through the renovator
to create a friction loss in the hose equal to the vacuum
at the hose cock.</p>

<p>As practically all systems are arranged to maintain a constant
vacuum at the vacuum producer and as the pipe friction
is generally less than the hose friction, the vacuum at the hose
cock will be practically the same when operating a floor brush
as with a carpet renovator.</p>

with 1-in hose, 6 in. with 1¹⁄₄-in. hose, and 5 in. with 1¹⁄₂-in.

<p>The quantities given for the shorter hose lengths are higher
than will be observed in actual practice, due to the increase in
the pipe friction, which will depend on the length of the pipe
lines. However, the results will illustrate the great increase
in the quantity of air which will pass these bare floor brushes
when operated on the same system with carpet renovators. If
the same number of bare floor renovators are to be used at
one time as there will be carpet renovators at some other time,<span class="pagenum" id="Page93">[93]</span>
that is, if the sweeper capacity must be maintained when using
bare floor brushes as when using carpet renovators, a much
larger air exhausting plant must be installed than would be
necessary to operate that number of carpet renovators.</p>

<p>If it were possible to so arrange the schedule of cleaning
operations that bare floor brushes were never used at the same
time as carpet renovators, the vacuum at the machine might be
reduced when operating the floor brushes to a point that would
reduce the quantity of air passing to within the capacity of a
machine designed to operate the same number of carpet renovators.
Unfortunately, this condition rarely exists and, therefore,
the vacuum must be maintained at the degree necessary
to operate the carpet renovators that may be in use at the
same time with the floor brushes.</p>

<p>It is also evident that if the length of hose used with bare
floor brushes could be limited to the maximum ever used with
the carpet renovators, a reduction in the capacity of the exhauster
necessary could be made. This is another condition
which the designer of the system cannot control.</p>

<p>With this combination of floor and carpet renovators, there
is no difference in the power consumption when any one of the
three sizes of hose is used. However, there is a considerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page95">[95]</span>
increase in the quantity of air passing the larger hose. This
leads to the statement made by some manufacturers that this
increase in air volume results in more efficient cleaning.</p>

<p>Tests given in <a href="#Page25">Chapter III</a> indicate that increase in air volume
does not result in any more rapid or efficient cleaning of
carpets. The results of actual use of the bare floor brush of
the bristle type show no gain when cleaning bare floors. As
stated in <a href="#Page60">Chapter IV</a>, the felt-faced renovator, being more
effective while it requires less air. In other words, it is the
degree of vacuum within the cleaner and not the quantity of
air which produces the cleaning in all cases where any degree
of vacuum is possible. When intimate contact between the
cleaner and the surface cleaned cannot be had, the volume of air
determines the efficiency of cleaning. However, the author
does not consider that an exhaustion of more than 60 to 70
cu. ft. of free air through cleaners of this type will increase
the efficiency to such an extent as to justify the increase of
power necessary to adapt a system to larger volumes.</p>

<p>The author considers that with a system in which brushes
of the bristle type are to be used, the exhauster should have
a capacity of 70 cu. ft. of free air per minute. Such a system
is termed by the author a “large volume system,” as already
mentioned in <a href="#Page60">Chapter IV</a>.</p>

<p>When the felt-covered floor renovator is used instead of the
brush, the vacuum within this renovator must not be permitted
to rise above 2 in. or the operation of the renovator on the
floor will be difficult. To accomplish this, it is necessary to
provide openings in the ends of the cleaning slot, as has been
explained in <a href="#Page60">Chapter IV</a>. If the vacuum at the hose cock be
assumed as 10 in. with 1-in hose, 6 in. with 1¹⁄₄-in. hose, and
5 in. with 1¹⁄₂-in. hose, and the vacuum within the felt-covered
floor renovator be maintained at 2 in. mercury the cubic feet of
free air passing the renovator with the various sizes and lengths
of hose will be:</p>

<p>In this case, the 1¹⁄₄-in. hose is the most economical size to
use, as was the case with the brush renovators. However, the
advantage over the 1¹⁄₂-in. hose is not as great as with the brush
renovator.</p>

<p>With this type of renovator, the manufacturer has some
control over the length of hose which the operator will use in
connection with the bare floor renovator, as he may open the
ends of the renovator just sufficiently to produce 2 in. of
vacuum under same with, say, 50 ft. of hose. Then, if the<span class="pagenum" id="Page97">[97]</span>
operator should attempt to use the renovator with 25 ft. of hose,
it will stick and push hard and he will soon learn that a longer
hose is necessary.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Conditions for Plant of Small Power.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">—For locations where
it is desirable to sacrifice efficiency somewhat to reduction in
the amount of power required, as in residences, the Type A
carpet renovator may be used and the vacuum under the same
reduced to 2 in. mercury, which will still do effective cleaning,
but at a slower rate, as was shown by tests in <a href="#Page25">Chapter III</a>.
This requires not exceeding 20 cu. ft. of free air per minute.</p>

<p>With this quantity of air the velocity in the hose must be
considered as, in order to have a clean hose at all times, it is
necessary to maintain a velocity in the hose of not less than
40 ft. per second. Referring to the diagram, <a href="#Fig48">Fig. 48</a>, it will
be seen that this velocity will not be obtained in any hose
larger than 1¹⁄₄ in. and this is, therefore, the largest size which
can be used. In all the former cases the velocity was so much
in excess of this minimum that its consideration was not necessary.</p>

<p>With a vacuum of 2 in. of mercury in the renovator and
20 cu. ft. of air passing, the vacuum at the hose cock will be:</p>

<p>In this case the increase in vacuum at the renovator would
not be objectionable as, with 4 in. vacuum at the hose cock, the
vacuum at the renovator would never reach the standard used
with the former deductions and the volume of air passing could,
therefore, never reach 29 cu. ft. Any increase, due to the use
of shorter hose, would, therefore, be an advantage in its approach
toward the standard set for the larger plants. Therefore,
we will assume that a vacuum of 4 in. mercury will be<span class="pagenum" id="Page98">[98]</span>
maintained at the hose cock with 1-in. hose and a vacuum of
2¹⁄₂ in. at the hose cock with 1¹⁄₄-in. hose.</p>

<p>The renovators for bare floor work will be the felt-covered
type and will be opened at the ends just sufficiently to limit the
vacuum within the same to 2 in. mercury when operating with
25 ft. of hose. This will require the passage of 40 cu. ft. of free
air per minute when 1-in. hose is used and 35 cu. ft. when
1¹⁄₄-in. hose is used. The horse power at the hose cock will be
0.39 H. P. with the 1-in. diameter hose and 0.17 H. P. with the
1¹⁄₄-in. hose. Here again we see that the 1¹⁄₄-in. hose is the
more economical to use.</p>

<p>If bristle brushes are used with this system at the same time
that carpet renovators are in use, the quantity of air which
will have to pass them, in order to maintain the vacuum on the
system at the proper point to do effective cleaning with the
carpet renovators, will be:</p>

<p>The use of these brushes in plants of more than one-sweeper
capacity would require the use of an exhauster of greater
capacity than is required for either the carpet or the bare
floor renovator. Where the plant is of but one-sweeper capacity,
the quantity of air that would pass these brushes, were the
plant of proper capacity to serve the carpet and floor renovators,
would not be sufficient to do effective work, as was explained
in <a href="#Page60">Chapter IV</a>. In such cases, this arrangement should
be prohibited.</p>

<p>A system of the type just described is what has been termed

<h3 class="inline"><b>Limit of Length for Hose.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">—The author has made the deductions
in this chapter, using 100 ft. of hose as the maximum
length. This is considered to be the greatest length that should
be used. The adoption of a shorter length is recommended by
many manufacturers, but the author does not consider that the
advantage to be obtained by the adoption of a shorter length
justifies the additional expense of piping which will result in
many cases. This will be governed by the character of the
building and, in many cases, it will be possible to use 50 ft. as
a maximum. It has been the practice of the author to lay out
his installations so that any point on the floor of any room may
be reached in the most direct line with 75 ft. of hose. When
this is done 100 ft. of hose will easily clean any part of the
walls or ceilings and give an ample allowance for running
around furniture or other obstructions.</p>

<p>The figures in this chapter will demonstrate to the reader the
part that the cleaning hose plays as a limiting factor in the
operation of a vacuum cleaning system and shows the care
that must be exercised in the selection of the proper hose for
each condition.</p>

<span class="smcap">Pipe and Fittings.</span></h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>As we continue to follow the dust-laden air in its passage
toward the vacuum producer we next encounter that portion of
the conduit which is permanently and rigidly fixed in place
in the building; namely, the pipe line, its fittings and other
appliances.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Hose Inlets.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">—The first portion of this conduit which we
must consider is the point where the hose is attached to the
pipe line; that is, the inlet, or, as it is often improperly termed,
the “outlet” valves.</p>

<p>As it is necessary to close the inlets air tight when they are
not in actual use, in order to prevent the entrance of air except
through the hose lines in use, some kind of a cut-off valve must
be provided, as well as a receptacle into which the end of the
hose may be connected when desired.</p>

<p>With the earlier systems a high degree of vacuum was carried
in the pipe lines and the vacuum producers were of small displacement.
Slight leakage would greatly reduce the capacity
of the system and the best form of valve was necessary. The
valve adopted was the ordinary ground-seat plug cock, on account
of its unobstructed air passage and air-tight closing. The
hose was connected to these cocks either by a ground-joint,
screwed coupling or by a slip coupling similar to those used to
unite the sections of the cleaning hose. An inlet cock of this
type is illustrated in <a href="#Fig51">Fig. 51</a>.</p>

<p>These cocks projected about 4¹⁄₂ in. beyond the face of the
finished wall and formed a considerable obstruction, especially
when located in halls or corridors. In order to reduce the projection
into the apartment the manufacturers of the systems
using screwed-hose couplings and substituted a projecting
nipple closed by a cap screwed in place. The whole projected
only ³⁄₄ in. beyond the finished wall line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page101">[101]</span></p>

<p>These outlets were suitable for use only with hose having
screwed connections. When an attempt is made to remove
the cap with the vacuum producer in operation, there is a tendency
for the vacuum to cause the cap to hug the last thread
and render its removal difficult. Also, when the suction is
finally broken it is accomplished with considerable hissing
noise.</p>

<div class="container w30emmax" id="Fig51">

<img src="images/illo101.jpg" alt="">

<p class="caption">FIG. 51. INLET COCK TO PREVENT AIR LEAKAGE WHEN NOT
IN USE.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>In order to permit the use of the slip type of hose coupling,
a hinged flap valve was substituted for the screwed cap, a rubber
gasket being placed under the cap. This was held firmly
in place by the vacuum in the pipe line. The interior of the
casting inside of the flap was turned to a slip fit for the end
of the hose coupling. With this type of valve and the slip hose
coupling, described in <a href="#Page80">Chapter VI</a>, it is possible to reverse the
hose to equalize wear and remove obstructions.</p>

<p>These inlets have been made with valves that are closed
only by gravity when there is no vacuum on the system and
many are so constructed that when opened wide they will remain
open with the vacuum on the piping. This type of valve
will often be opened by the inquisitive person when no vacuum
exists in the system and as there are no immediate results,
they may be left open with the result that there will be a very
large leakage of air on starting the vacuum producer. This
makes it necessary for some one to make a tour of the building
in order to close the valve which is open before the system can
be efficiently operated. If the vacuum producer is designed
to operate several renovators simultaneously, it may not be
discovered that there are any valves open and a considerable
amount of power will be wasted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page102">[102]</span></p>

<p>In order to overcome this difficulty it is necessary to provide
a spring on the hinge of the flap valve that will automatically
close the valve whenever the hose is withdrawn. When the
inlets are located in public places they should be fitted with a
lock attachment to prevent them from being opened by unauthorized
persons.</p>

<p>A valve of this type is illustrated in <a href="#Fig52">Fig. 52</a>. This valve
has a projection on its inner face which engages with a ridge
on the hose couplings, preventing the removal of the hose without
slightly raising the cap and making it impossible to accidentally
pull the hose out of the inlet.</p>

<p class="caption">FIG. 52. TYPE OF AUTOMATIC SELF-CLOSING INLET COCK.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The particular valve here shown is suitable for use only with
the all-rubber hose connection described in <a href="#Page80">Chapter VI</a>.</p>

<p>We must next consider the material of which the conduit
itself is to be made. The commercial wrought-iron or mild
steel, screw-jointed pipe, such as is used for water and steam
lines, is probably the best suited for this purpose and was the
first material used. In earlier installations the pipe was galvanized,
but, owing to the tendency for the zinc coating to
form irregularities within the pipe, its use has been abandoned
in favor of the commercial black iron pipe.</p>

<p>Seamless drawn tubing would undoubtedly make the ideal
material for this purpose. However, the ordinary butt or lap-welded
pipe is satisfactory and is now generally used.</p>

<p>Sheet metal pipe was introduced by one manufacturer but
its use was shortly abandoned in favor of the commercial pipe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page103">[103]</span></p>

<p>As joints and changes in direction are necessary in the pipe
lines, some sort of fittings must be used. The ideal conduit for
passage of dust-laden air should be of uniform bore and as
smooth on the inside as a gun barrel. Various attempts have
been made to accomplish this result in commercial installations,
one of which is illustrated in <a href="#Fig53">Fig. 53</a>. These fittings are made
up of three parts for a coupling and four for a branch or
change in direction. One of these is screwed on to the end of
each piece of pipe, the pipe butting against a shoulder and the
end of the pipe made to register with the bore of the fitting by
reaming. This piece is faced true and fitted against the face
of the casting, forming the bend or branch, or fitted against
the piece on the end of the other length of pipe. A thin gasket
is placed between them, a projecting ring on one piece fitting
into a groove on the other, causing the bore of the two halves
to register. The two halves are joined together by the
V-grooved clamp, held in place by a small bolt. This is theoretically
an ideal joint, but the clamp is not of sufficient
strength to withstand the strain of settlement of the building
and breakages are frequent. Several instances of this character,
particularly on steamers, have come to the observation of the
author, and there are several buildings which have been roughed
in with this type of fitting, used on concealed piping, which were
found to be useless on the completion of the building, due to
breaking of the joints in inaccessible places.</p>

<img src="images/illo103.jpg" alt="">

<p class="caption">FIG. 53. “SMOOTH BORE” PIPE COUPLING.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>A modification of this joint which will have ample strength
can be made by using standard pipe flanges, screwing the pipe<span class="pagenum" id="Page104">[104]</span>
through the flange and facing the end off in a lathe. Fittings
could be made with a bore equal to that of the pipe and proper
alignment secured by the use of dowel pins, as illustrated in
<a href="#Fig54">Fig. 54</a>. The cost of making this joint would be high and they
would occupy too much space to be easily concealed in partitions,
furring or other channels usually provided for the
reception of such piping.</p>

<p>The standard Durham recessed drainage fitting, having the
inside cored to the bore of the pipe and recesses provided for
the threads as used in connection with the modern plumbing
system, if left ungalvanized and having the inside well sand-blasted
to remove all rough places, makes a serviceable fitting.
Care should be exercised to cut the threads on the piping of
proper depth to allow the end of the pipe to come as close to
the shoulder of the recess as practicable and to obtain a tight
joint. The end of the pipe should be carefully reamed before
assembling.</p>

<p>These fittings have become standard with nearly all manufacturers
and are illustrated in <a href="#Fig55">Fig. 55</a>, which shows the right
and wrong way to install same.</p>

<p>Trouble was experienced on some of the earlier systems using
high vacuum with the fittings cutting out on the side subjected
to the impact of the dust-laden air. To overcome this
trouble one manufacturer re-inforced the fittings by increasing
the thickness of metal at the point affected. The trouble was
undoubtedly caused by too high a velocity in the pipe line, as
in the case of the small brass stems, explained in <a href="#Page70">Chapter V</a>.
With the introduction of vacuum control and larger pipes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page105">[105]</span>
this trouble disappeared and the special fittings never came
into general use.</p>

<p>While the utmost care should be taken to prevent stoppage

</div><!--container-->

<p>Matches are perhaps the most frequent cause of stoppage in
pipe lines. Stoppage from this cause can be largely avoided
by the use of pipe of sufficient size to permit the match to turn
a complete somersault within the pipe whenever it catches
against a slight obstruction or rough place in the pipe or<span class="pagenum" id="Page107">[107]</span>
fittings. A 2-in. diameter pipe is just large enough to permit
this and smaller sizes of pipe should be avoided whenever
possible.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Pipe Friction.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">—The friction loss in piping follows the same
law as that in hose lines and is easily computed by use of the
chart (<a href="#Fig56">Fig. 56</a>), which is constructed on the same general
principle as the chart of hose friction (<a href="#Fig48">Fig. 48</a>). The directions
for use of the hose chart apply to the pipe chart. In computing
this chart the actual inside diameter of the commercial wrought-iron
pipes have been used instead of the nominal diameters,
resulting in an increased capacity for all sizes except 2¹⁄₂-in.
which is less than the nominal diameter.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Determination of Proper Size Pipe.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">—Friction in the pipe
lines tends to increase the vacuum to be maintained and therefore
the power to be expended at the vacuum producer and
should be kept as low as possible. The pipe sizes should be
made as large as conditions will permit. The limit of size is
fixed by the velocity in the pipe. When it is necessary to lift
the dirt to any extent, the velocity should not be allowed to
fall below 40 ft. per second at any time. When the pipe is a
vertical drop, the velocity does not matter as gravitation will
assist the air current in removing the dirt. When the line is
horizontal a lower velocity than 40 ft. per second is permissible
at times, provided that this minimum velocity is exceeded at
frequent intervals to flush out any dirt that has lodged in the
pipe during periods of low velocity.</p>

<p>If a Type A renovator is used with 1-in. hose and a vacuum
of 10 in. of mercury maintained at the hose cock, the minimum
air passing, with 100 ft. of hose in use, will be 29 cu. ft. of free
air per minute, which is equivalent to 44 cu. ft. at 10 in. of
vacuum. The entering velocity in the pipe should be calculated
with air at this density. This will give a velocity of 50 ft.
per second in a 1¹⁄₂-in. pipe, but only 30 ft. per second in a 2-in.
pipe. Therefore, the 1¹⁄₂-in. pipe is the largest that should be
used where lifts occur on a line serving but one Type A renovator
with 1-in hose. When the renovator is tilted at a considerable
angle or lifted from the carpet, as will frequently
occur in cleaning operations, the quantity of air passing the
renovator will be upwards of 42 cu. ft. of free air, equivalent<span class="pagenum" id="Page108">[108]</span>
to 62 cu. ft. at 10-in. vacuum. When this occurs the velocity
in a 2-in. pipe will be 44 ft. per second, which will be ample to
flush a horizontal line of piping.</p>

<p>If 1¹⁄₄-in. hose is used with a Type A renovator, the minimum
quantity of air will be 29 cu. ft. and the vacuum entering the
pipe will be 6 in. mercury, giving an equivalent volume of 37
cu. ft. This will produce a velocity of 42 ft. per second in a
1¹⁄₂-in. pipe, which is the largest that can be used where a lift
occurs. However, when the renovator is lifted free of the
carpet, the air quantity will be 62 cu. ft. of free air, equivalent
to 80 cu. ft. at 6 in. of vacuum, and will produce a velocity
of 39 ft. per second in a 2¹⁄₂-in. pipe. This would be just about
sufficient to flush a horizontal line.</p>

<p>If 1¹⁄₂-in. hose were used the air quantity will be 29 cu. ft.
and the vacuum entering the pipe 5 in. mercury, equivalent
to 35 cu. ft. This will give a velocity in a 1¹⁄₂-in. pipe of
40 ft. per second. When the renovator is raised from the carpet,
the air quantity will be upwards of 90 cu. ft. of free air,
equivalent to 110 cu. ft. at the density of that entering the pipe,
and will produce a velocity of 33 ft. per second in a 3-in. pipe.
This is too low to thoroughly flush a horizontal pipe.</p>

<p>The figures given above are repeated from <a href="#Page80">Chapter VI</a> and
show that the use of 1¹⁄₄-in. instead of 1-in. hose, permits the
use of a larger-sized horizontal pipe line for serving one renovator,
but that the use of 1¹⁄₂-in. hose, instead of 1¹⁄₄-in., will
not permit of any enlargement in the pipe size. Since we have
seen in <a href="#Page80">Chapter VI</a> that a 1¹⁄₄-in. hose gives the least expenditure
of power when used with a Type A renovator, there
will be no gain from a reduction in the pipe friction due to
the adoption of this hose.</p>

<p>The dependence on the raising of the renovator from the floor
to flush out a larger pipe line should not be carried beyond that
to be obtained from a single renovator. That is, when the pipe
must serve more than one renovator at the same time, the quantity
of air that two or more renovators will pass, if they were
raised from the floor at the same time, should not be used in
determining the limiting velocity in the pipe, as such an occurrence
is not likely to be obtained often enough to thoroughly
flush the pipe. Furthermore, there will be times when this pipe
will have to serve only one renovator and the pipe will not be<span class="pagenum" id="Page109">[109]</span>
adequately flushed. When the pipe is serving more than one
renovator, the actual air passing the renovators should be used
in determining the maximum size of pipe and it is advisable to
use this maximum size in nearly all cases where the structural
conditions will permit.</p>

<p>These friction losses are figured with a density of air in the

CARPET RENOVATORS UNDER DIFFERENT CONDITIONS.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>These friction losses are obtained only when carpet renovators
are used exclusively and all the renovators are held in
the proper position to perform the most economical cleaning.
In actual practice this condition will not exist except when one
renovator is used. Where more than one renovator is in use
simultaneously, some of the renovators will be raised from the
floors at the time others are in position to do effective cleaning
and will admit a greater quantity of air, increasing the friction.
This is not a serious condition as the time that the renovators
will be raised is only a small part of the total time spent in
cleaning and will merely reduce the efficiency of the other
renovators temporarily. However, when brushes or floor renovators
are used at the same time as the carpet renovators, there
will be a continuous flow of air in greater quantities through<span class="pagenum" id="Page111">[111]</span>
these brushes, which will permanently increase the friction loss.
The use of a single brush or floor renovator with the same sized
pipe as is necessary to operate the carpet renovator will not
reduce the efficiency of the brush, as a high degree of vacuum
at the brush or floor renovator is not necessary or even permissible
and a further slight reduction will not affect the operation
of these renovators.</p>

<p>When a brush or floor renovator is used on the furthest outlet
from the vacuum producer at the same time that carpet
renovators are being used on outlets nearer the vacuum producer,
the larger quantity of air passing the brush will tend to
reduce the vacuum at the hose cock to which the carpet renovator
is attached and thereby impair its efficiency. For example,
if we have a brush renovator connected through 100 ft.
of 1-in. hose to an outlet at the end of a pipe line 400 ft. long,
properly designed to serve two carpet renovators, the vacuum
at the separators should be maintained at 10-in., plus 2 × 0.20
plus 2 × 0.30, or 11 in. of mercury. Suppose that this vacuum
is automatically maintained at this point and a carpet renovator
be attached 200 ft. from end of pipe (<a href="#Fig57">Fig. 57</a>). The
quantity of air passing through the 2¹⁄₂-in. pipe B-C will be
approximately 29 plus 40 or 69 cu. ft., and the friction loss in
this pipe will be 1.1 in. The vacuum maintained at the outlet
B (<a href="#Fig57">Fig. 57</a>) will be 9.9 in. or approximately the correct vacuum
to maintain 4¹⁄₂-in. vacuum at the renovator “a.” The friction
loss in the pipe line from B to A will be 0.7 in. and the resulting
vacuum at the hose cock A will be 9.2 in. The quantity
of air passing the brush will be 40 cu. ft. Under these conditions
there will be no loss in efficiency of cleaning due to the
brush renovator being used on the end of the line. If the
operator using the brush at the outlet A should use only 25
ft. of hose instead of 100 ft. (<a href="#Fig58">Fig. 58</a>) the air passing this
brush will be 75 cu. ft. and the vacuum at the hose cock A
will be 6.8 in. The vacuum at the hose cock B will be 8.8 in.
and the vacuum at the carpet renovator “a” will be reduced
to 3¹⁄₂ in. with 25 cu. ft. of air passing, which will reduce
the efficiency of the carpet renovator “a.”</p>

<p>If the brush renovator be attached to the hose cock B (<a href="#Fig59">Fig.
59</a>), using 25 ft. of hose, the vacuum at hose cock B will be<span class="pagenum" id="Page112">[112]</span>
9 in. and the brush renovator will pass 85 cu. ft. of air, while
the vacuum at hose cock A will now be reduced to 8.6 in. and
the vacuum at the renovator will be reduced to 3 in. mercury
and the air passing to 23 cu. ft.</p>

<p>If a brush type of renovator be used at each outlet, with 25
ft. of hose in each case and the vacuum at the separator be
maintained at 11 in. mercury the vacuum at hose cock B will
be 7 in. and brush “a” will pass 76 cu. ft. of air while the
vacuum at hose cock “a” will be 5 in. and brush “b” will
pass 63 cu. ft. of air or a total of 144 cu. ft., which will be
in excess of the 70 cu. ft. per renovator recommended as the
capacity of the plant in <a href="#Page80">Chapter VI</a>. This will not result in
any loss of efficiency if the vacuum producer be designed to
handle but 140 cu. ft. as a maximum, for the vacuum at the
separator will then fall to a point where but 140 cu. ft. passes,
resulting in a decrease in the vacuum throughout the system.
But as only brushes are now in use there will be no loss in
efficiency, owing to the reduction in the vacuum at the brushes.</p>

<p>When 1¹⁄₄-in. hose is used with a carpet renovator at the end
of the pipe line connected through 100 ft. of hose and a brush
at the hose cock B connected through 25 ft. of hose (<a href="#Fig60">Fig. 60</a>),
the worst case of the three already cited, the vacuum at the
separator being maintained at that necessary to carry 4¹⁄₂ in.
when two carpet renovators are in use, the vacuum at the hose
cock B will be 4.5 in. and brush “a” will pass 116 cu. ft. of
air while the vacuum at hose cock A will be 4.4 in. and the
vacuum in renovator “b” will be 3.7 in and will pass 24
cu. ft. of air.</p>

<p>These are better cleaning conditions than were obtained when
1-in. hose was used. It will be noted that the total air passing
the exhauster is now 140 cu. ft. and this must not be reduced
or there will be a falling off in the vacuum at the carpet renovator
“b.” It is, therefore, necessary for the exhauster to be
capable of handling 140 cu. ft. of air or 70 cu. ft. of air per
renovator in order to do effective carpet cleaning when carpet
renovators and brushes are used in conjunction.</p>

<p>When two floor brushes are used with the above arrangement
of pipe and hose, the vacuum must fall considerably or<span class="pagenum" id="Page113">[113]</span>
the air quantity be greatly increased. However, the reduction
in vacuum will not result in serious loss in efficiency when only
brushes are in use.</p>

<p>When a larger number of sweepers are used with a system
of piping, it is necessary to allow 70 cu. ft. of free air per
sweeper in figuring the sizes of pipe to be used, and the total
loss of pressure in the piping between the outlet farthest from
the vacuum producer and that nearest to same must be limited
in order to prevent too wide a difference in the vacuum at the
hose cock when all the sweepers for which the plant is designed
are in use. The author considers that this loss in pressure
should not be greater than 2 in. mercury in order to give satisfactory
results.</p>

<p>Before the piping system can be laid out and the sizes of
piping determined it is necessary to ascertain, first, the number
of sweepers to be operated simultaneously and the number
of risers necessary to properly serve these sweepers.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Number of Sweepers to be Operated.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">—This is determined
by the character of the surfaces to be cleaned, the amount of
such surface, and the time allowed for cleaning.</p>

<p>It has been demonstrated in actual practice that one operator
can clean as high as 2,500 sq. ft. of carpet when same is on
floors of comparatively large areas, and not over 1,500 sq. ft.
when the carpets are on small rooms; 2,000 sq. ft. is considered
to be a fair average.</p>

<p>Bare floors are cleaned more rapidly. In school house work
an ordinary class room has been cleaned in 10 minutes, or at
the rate of 7,200 sq. ft. per hour, but time is occupied in moving
from one room to another and the writer considers 5,000 sq. ft.
per hour as rapid cleaning and 3,500 sq. ft. as a fair average.</p>

<p>The time of cleaning will vary in buildings of different character
and used for different purposes. In office buildings the
cleaning force work throughout the night or about 10 hours,
while in school houses the cleaning is done by the janitor force
which has been on duty throughout the school period and the
time is necessarily limited to about two or three hours after
school hours, the corridors and play rooms being cleaned during
the school period and only the class rooms being cleaned after
closing time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page114">[114]</span></p>

<p>Let us assume, as an example, an office building having eight
floors each 100 ft. × 150 ft., with a floor plan as shown in
<a href="#Fig61">Fig. 61</a>.</p>

<p>The corridors, stairs and elevator halls will probably be
floored with marble which must be scrubbed in order to remove
the stain accumulated during the day and they will not be considered
in connection with a dry vacuum cleaning system. The
area of the floors in the offices on any floor will be approximately
10,000 sq. ft. and one floor can be cleaned by one operator in
5 hours, or two floors during the cleaning period, so the plant
must be of sufficient size to serve four sweepers simultaneously.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>In a school house containing four class rooms, where the
janitor cleans the play rooms and corridors during the school
period, as can be readily done with a vacuum cleaner since
there will be no dust scattered about to fill the air and render
it unsanitary, the class rooms can easily be cleaned in one hour
by one operator. The author considers that one sweeper capacity
for each six to eight rooms is ample for a large school.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page115">[115]</span></p>

<p>Buildings of special construction and used for special purposes
must be considered differently according to the conditions
to be met, but the size of the plant can be readily determined
in each case by use of the rules already given.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Number of Risers to be Installed.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">—Much difference of
opinion exists among the various manufacturers of vacuum
cleaning systems as to the maximum length of hose that should
be used with a cleaning system, and as this maximum length
determines the number of risers to be installed, some fixed
standard is necessary. As already stated in <a href="#Page80">Chapter VI</a>, the
author considers that this maximum should be fixed at 75 ft.;
that is, the risers should be so spaced that all parts of the floor
of the building can be reached with 75 ft. of hose. Where 50
ft. is used as a maximum, as is recommended by many manufacturers,
the number of risers would be increased, incurring a
greater cost of installation and requiring the operator to shift
his hose from one inlet to another more often than would be
the case where fewer inlets were used, and more time would
be required in cleaning, with a slight reduction in the power.
The author does not consider that this reduction in power would
be sufficient to offset the additional time required to change
the hose from one inlet to another.</p>

<p>The best and quickest way to determine the number of risers
necessary is to cut a piece of string to the length representing
75 ft. on the scale of the plans, and by running this
around the plan using corridor doors for access to all rooms,
wherever possible, locate the riser so that every point can be
reached with the string. In the case of the building illustrated
in <a href="#Fig61">Fig. 61</a> four risers located as shown will be necessary.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Size of Risers.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">—Before we can determine the size of risers
to be installed it is necessary to determine the probable number
of sweepers that will be attached to any one riser simultaneously.
In the case of the building (<a href="#Fig61">Fig. 61</a>) it is possible
that there may be four sweepers attached to one riser and it is
also possible that there may be but one, and two sweepers to
a riser is considered to be a safe assumption. The author uses
the following rule in determining the size of risers to use:</p>

<p>Where the number of sweepers is double the number of risers,
assume that all sweepers will be on one riser simultaneously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page116">[116]</span></p>

<p>Where the number of sweepers is equal to the number of
risers, assume that half the sweepers will be on one riser
simultaneously.</p>

<p>Where the number of sweepers is half the number of risers,
assume that one-quarter of the sweepers will be on one riser
simultaneously.</p>

<p>When no lifts occur a low velocity in the riser is not objectionable
and the size of the riser should be made equal to the
size of the horizontal branch thereto throughout its length,
wherever this branch is not larger than 2¹⁄₂ in. diameter. When
larger, reductions in the riser can be made until 2¹⁄₂ in. is
reached when this size should be maintained throughout the
remainder of its length. No riser should be made less than
2¹⁄₂ in. unless a lift is necessary.</p>

<p>Before finally fixing the size of riser to be used in any
case the size of the branch in the horizontal lines serving the
same must be approximately determined.</p>

<p>These sizes will be dependent on the location in which it is
necessary to install the vacuum producer. In the case of the
building (<a href="#Fig61">Fig. 61</a>) the most desirable location for the vacuum
producer will be in the exact center of the building.</p>

<p>With the vacuum producer centrally located the longest run
from any riser will be 55 ft. To this we must add:</p>

<p>&#8199;5 ft. for each long-turn elbow.</p>

<p>10 ft. for each short-turn elbow.</p>

<p>10 ft. for entrance to each long sweep Y branch.</p>

<p>20 ft. for entrance to a tee branch, except at sweeper inlets on
risers, where 10 ft. is ample.</p>

<p>In calculating the riser friction for risers under 150 ft. in
length the whole capacity of the riser can be assumed as being

<p>In the eight-story building (<a href="#Fig61">Fig. 61</a>) the length of the riser
from basement ceiling to eighth floor will be 100 ft. and the
length to be figured, 50 ft. The equivalent length of pipe line
for any of the risers, with the vacuum producer centrally
located, will be:</p>

<p>Each riser is to serve two sweepers and must pass 140 cu. ft.
of free air per minute. This will give a friction loss in a
2¹⁄₂-in. pipe of 2 in. mercury, if 10 in. mercury be maintained
at the hose cock and 1-in. hose used; and 1.5 in. mercury if 6 in.
mercury be maintained at the hose cock and 1¹⁄₄-in. hose used.
Either of these figures are within the limits set for the maximum
friction loss and 2¹⁄₂-in. pipe will be the proper size
for the risers and their branches in the basement.</p>

<p>The portion of the main in the basement that serves the two
risers on either side of the building (portion “ab,” <a href="#Fig61">Fig. 61</a>)
must be of such size as will produce the same loss in vacuum
with 280 cu. ft. of air passing as the 2¹⁄₂-in. pipe gives with
140 cu. ft. of air passing. This may be determined from any
table of equalization of pipes or may be obtained from the
chart, <a href="#Fig48">Fig. 48</a>, in the following manner:</p>

<p>Find the intersection of the horizontal line “140” with the
diagonal representing a 2¹⁄₂-in. pipe and pass on the nearest
vertical to its intersection with the horizontal line “280.” The
diagonal inclined toward the left passing nearest this intersection
will be the pipe size required. In this case a 3-in. pipe will
give a slightly greater friction and will be sufficient.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it is rarely possible to locate the vacuum producer
in as favorable a point as that given in the illustration,
but an effort should always be made to select a location as
nearly central to all risers as possible. The basements of modern
office buildings are generally crowded and the space assigned
to the mechanical equipment is limited and owing to the necessity
of ventilation, the vacuum producer is generally located
near the outside of the building.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page118">[118]</span></p>

<p>Probably the best location that could be obtained in this case
would be at “d” (<a href="#Fig62">Fig. 62</a>). The length of piping to risers 1
and 2 would now be the same as that to all risers in case of
<a href="#Fig61">Fig. 61</a>, but the distance to risers 3 and 4 will be increased 50
ft. It will be possible to increase the size of the pipe line
“bd” to the maximum size to serve four sweepers, or 3¹⁄₂ in.,
the risers and their branches to remain 2¹⁄₂ in.</p>

<p>The total friction loss to risers 1 and 2 will now be:</p>

<p>When 1-in. hose is used the density of the air entering the
2¹⁄₂-in. pipe is equivalent to a vacuum of 10 in. mercury and
the friction loss in the 2¹⁄₂-in. pipe will be 1.9 in. mercury.
When 1¹⁄₄-in. hose is used, the density of the air entering the
pipe will be equivalent to a vacuum of 6-in. mercury and the
friction loss in the 2¹⁄₂-in. pipe will be 1.32 in. mercury.</p>

<p>The density of the air entering the 3¹⁄₂-in. pipe, “bd,” will
be equivalent to a vacuum of 11.9 in. mercury when 1-in. hose
is used, and to 7.32 in. mercury when 1¹⁄₄-in. hose is used.
The friction loss in the 3¹⁄₂-in. pipe will be 0.31 and 0.23 in.<span class="pagenum" id="Page119">[119]</span>
mercury, respectively. Total friction loss to inlets on risers
1 and 2 will be 2.21 in. with 1-in. hose in use, and 1.55 in. with
1¹⁄₄-in. hose.</p>

<p>To obtain the friction loss to inlets on risers 3 and 4 the
friction loss in the pipe “bc” must be added to the above
figures. With 50 ft. of 3¹⁄₂-in. pipe carrying 280 cu. ft. free
air the friction loss is 0.6 in. when the vacuum in the pipe is
12 in. and 0.4 when the vacuum in the pipe is 8 in.</p>

<p>The total loss of vacuum to inlets on risers 3 and 4 will be 2.91
in. if 1-in. hose is used and 1.95 in. if 1¹⁄₄-in. hose is used. In
this case, the total loss from inlet to vacuum producer is approximately
equal to the maximum variation of vacuum permitted
at sweeper outlets when 1¹⁄₄-in. hose is used, but is
greater than when 1-in. hose is used.</p>

<p>However, it is the variation in vacuum at the hose cock
farthest from and that nearest to the vacuum producer that
fixes the maximum variation allowable. In this case it will be
the difference in vacuum between an inlet on riser 1 or 2 and a
similar inlet on riser 3 or 4. The difference in vacuum at the
bases of these risers will be the friction loss in the pipe “bc,”
and the total difference in friction in the risers will occur when
one sweeper is attached to the lowest inlet on one riser, and
one sweeper on the eighth and one on the seventh floor on the
other riser. The friction loss in the riser having the two
sweepers attached to its upper inlets will be:</p>

<p>15 ft. of 2¹⁄₂-in. pipe from seventh to eighth floors, 70 cu. ft.
of free air per minute, or 0.051 in. with a density equivalent
to 6-in. vacuum, and 0.075 in. with a density equivalent to 10-in.
vacuum.</p>

<p>85 ft. of 2¹⁄₂-in. pipe from first to seventh floors, 140 cu. ft.
free air per minute, or 0.25 in. with a density equivalent to
6-in. vacuum, and 0.42 in. with a density equivalent to 10-in.
vacuum.</p>

<p>The total difference in vacuum at the hose cocks will be:</p>

<p>0.051 + 0.25 + 0.4 = 0.7 in. with 6-in. vacuum at the hose cock.</p>

<p>0.075 + 0.42 + 0.6 = 1.15 in. with 10-in. vacuum at the hose cock.</p>

<p>Either of these values are well within the maximum variation.
It is, therefore, evident that when the vacuum producer<span class="pagenum" id="Page120">[120]</span>
cannot be centrally located that a piping system which will
give the most nearly equal length of pipe to each riser will
yield the best results.</p>

<p>A vacuum cleaning system for serving a passenger car storage
yard will best illustrate the effect of long lines of piping.
A typical yard having 8 tracks, each of sufficient length to
accommodate 10 cars, is shown in <a href="#Fig63">Fig. 63</a>. The vacuum producer
in this case is located at the side of the yard at one end,
which is not an unusual condition.</p>

<div class="container" id="Fig63">

<img src="images/illo122.jpg" alt="">

<p class="caption">FIG. 63. VACUUM CLEANING LAYOUT FOR A PASSENGER CAR
STORAGE YARD.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The capacity of this yard will be 80 cars which must generally
be cleaned between the hours of midnight and 6 A. M.,
or a period of 6 hours for cleaning.</p>

<p>It will require one operator approximately 20 minutes to
thoroughly clean the floor of one car, on account of the difficulty
in getting under and around the seat legs. In addition to this,
it is also necessary to clean the upholstery of the seats and their
backs, which will require approximately 25 minutes more or
45 minutes for one operator to thoroughly clean one car.
Therefore, one operator can clean 8 cars during the cleaning
period and a ten-sweeper plant will be necessary to serve the
yard.</p>

<p>One lateral cleaning pipe must be run between every pair of
tracks or four laterals in all to properly reach all cars without
running the hose across tracks where it might be cut in two
by the shifting of trains.</p>

<p>Outlets should be spaced two car lengths apart in order to
bring an outlet opposite the end of every second car. This will
make it possible to bring the hose in through the end of the
car at the door opening and clean the entire car from one end
which can be done by using 100 ft. of hose. The use of double
the number of outlets and 50 ft. of hose would require two attachments
of the hose to clean one car resulting in a loss of
time in cleaning and is not recommended.</p>

<p>In this case, 100 ft. of hose would be the shortest length that
would be likely to be used and 60 cu. ft. of free air would be the
maximum to be allowed for when using 1¹⁄₄-in. hose.</p>

<p>The simplest layout for a piping system to serve this yard
would be that shown in <a href="#Fig63">Fig. 63</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page121">[121]</span></p>

<p>When the entire yard is filled with cars and the entire force
of ten operators is started to clean them it would be possible to
so divide them that not over three operators would be working
on any one lateral and this condition will be assumed to exist.
The maximum size for the laterals between the tracks will be
that for three sweepers, or 3 in., and it will not be safe to use
this size beyond the second inlet from the manifold, from which
point to the end of the lateral it must be made 2¹⁄₂ in., the
maximum size for either one or two sweepers. The total loss
of pressure due to friction from the inlet at x (<a href="#Fig63">Fig. 63</a>) to
the separator can be readily calculated from the chart (<a href="#Fig56">Fig.
56</a>) as follows:</p>

<p>This loss will be the maximum that is possible under any
condition as it is computed with three sweepers working on the
three most remote inlets on laterals “xy” and “vw” and with
two sweepers on laterals “tu” and “rs.” The pipes are the
largest which will give a velocity of 40 ft. per second with the
full load and at the density which will actually exist in the
pipe lines with the vacuum maintained at the separator of
20 in. mercury in all cases, except the pipe from “s” to separator.
There the size was maintained at 6 in., as it was not
considered advisable to increase this on account of the reduced
velocity which would occur when less than the total number of
sweepers might be working.</p>

<p>As bare floor brushes will be used for cleaning coaches it is
not considered advisable to reduce the air quantity below that<span class="pagenum" id="Page122">[122]</span>
required by such renovators. However, when carpet renovators
are used in Pullman cars and upholstery renovators are used
on the cushions of both coaches and Pullmans, the air quantity
will be reduced. This condition may exist at any time, also
one of these carpet or upholstery renovators may be in use on
one of the inlets most remote from the separator at the same
time that nine floor brushes are in use on the remaining outlets.
In that case a vacuum at the separator of less than 20 in.
would result in a decrease in the vacuum at the inlet to which
this renovator was attached. The vacuum at the separator must,
therefore, be maintained at the point stated.</p>

<p>With such a vacuum there will be variation in the vacuum
at the hose cocks of from 6 in. to 20 in. or seven times the
maximum allowable variation in vacuum at the hose cocks.</p>

<p>If 1-in. hose be used, the maximum air quantities will be 40
cu. ft. per sweeper. If we start with a vacuum at the inlet
“x” of 10-in. mercury, the vacuum at the separator will again
be 20 in. and we now have a variation of 10 in. between the
nearest and most remote inlet from the separator, or five times
the maximum allowed.</p>

<p>Either of these conditions is practically prohibitive, due to:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page123">[123]</span></p>

<p>1. The excessive power consumption at the separator. 50 H. P.
in case 1¹⁄₄-in. hose is used, and 33 H. P. in case 1-in. hose
is used.</p>

<p>2. The excessive capacity of the exhauster in order to handle
the air at such low density, a displacement of 1,800 cu. ft.
being necessary in case 1¹⁄₄-in. hose is used and 1,200 cu. ft.
in case 1-in hose is used.</p>

<p>3. The great variation in the vacuum at the hose cocks which
will admit the passage of so much more air through a brush
renovator on an outlet close to the separator as to render useless
the calculations already made, or the high vacuum at the
carpet or upholstery renovators would render their operation
practically impossible.</p>

<p class="caption">FIG. 64. ARRANGEMENT OF PIPING RECOMMENDED AS BEST FOR
PASSENGER CAR STORAGE YARD.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>Such a layout must be at once dismissed as impractical, and
some other arrangement must be adapted. The arrangement of
piping shown in <a href="#Fig64">Fig. 64</a> is considered by the author to be the
best that can be devised for this case.</p>

<p>With this arrangement the vacuum at the separator must be
maintained at 11.50 in. mercury to insure a vacuum of 6 in.
mercury at the outlet “x” under the most unfavorable conditions,
and the maximum variation in vacuum at the inlets will
be 3.45 in. mercury when 1¹⁄₄-in. hose is used. This will give
a maximum vacuum under a carpet renovator of 7¹⁄₂ in. mercury<span class="pagenum" id="Page124">[124]</span>
with 37 cu. ft. of air passing and will permit 70 cu. ft.
of free air per minute to pass a brush renovator when operating
with 100 ft. of hose attached to the inlet at which the highest
vacuum is maintained. Both of these conditions will permit
satisfactory operation and the increased air quantities will not
seriously affect the calculations already made. The maximum
horse power required at the separator will now be 20.5 as
against over 50 in the case of the piping arrangement shown in
<a href="#Fig63">Fig. 63</a>, and will require an exhauster having a displacement of
950 cu. ft. instead of 1,800 cu. ft. required with the former
layout.</p>

<p>If 1-in. hose is used and 10 in. mercury maintained at the
outlet “x” under the same conditions as before, the vacuum
at the separator will be 14.50 in. and the maximum variation
in the vacuum at the inlets will be 3 in., which will give a
maximum vacuum under a carpet renovator of 6 in. mercury
with 32 cu. ft. of air passing and will permit the passage of
45 cu. ft. of free air through a brush renovator when operated
at the end of 100 ft. of hose attached to the outlet at which
the highest vacuum is maintained. This is a more uniform result,
than was noted when 1¹⁄₄-in. hose was used.</p>

<p>The maximum horse power which will be required at the
separator will now be 18.6 and the maximum displacement in
the exhauster will be 740 cu. ft.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, evident that, where very long runs of piping
are necessary and where 100 ft. of hose will always be necessary,
the use of 1-in. hose will require less power and a smaller displacement
exhauster than would be required with 1¹⁄₄-in. hose,
without affecting the efficiency of the cleaning operations, and
at the same time rendering the operation of the renovators on
extreme ends of the system more uniform.</p>

<p>The example cited in <a href="#Fig63">Figs. 63</a> and <a href="#Fig64">64</a> is not by any means an
extreme case to be met in cleaning systems for car yards, and
the larger the system the greater will be the economy obtained
with 1-in. hose.</p>

<p>Such conditions, however, are confined almost entirely to layouts
of this character and will seldom be met in layouts within
any single building. This is fortunate, as the train cleaning is<span class="pagenum" id="Page125">[125]</span>
practically the only place where the use of 100 ft. of hose can
be assured at all times.</p>

<p>Very tall buildings offer a similar condition although the
laterals are now vertical and can be kept large enough to sufficiently
reduce the friction without danger of deposit of dirt
in them, and the horizontal branches will be short and also
large enough to keep the friction within reasonable limits without
danger of deposit of dust.</p>

<p>Where large areas within one or a group of buildings must
be served by one cleaning system, better results can often be
obtained by installing the dust separator at or near the center
of the system of risers instead of close to the vacuum producer,
as indicated in <a href="#Fig65">Fig. 65</a>. When this is done, the pipe leading
from the separator to the vacuum producer carries only clean
air and can be made as large as desired and the friction loss reduced,
resulting in a considerable reduction in the power required
to operate the system.</p>

<p class="caption">FIG. 65. GOOD LOCATION FOR DUST SEPARATOR WHERE LARGE
AREAS ARE SERVED BY ONE CLEANING SYSTEM.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>Where the system becomes still larger, two or more separators
located at centers of groups of risers can be used and clean
air pipes of any desired size run to the vacuum producer (<a href="#Fig66">Fig.
66</a>). When more than one separator is used care should be
exercised in proportioning the pipe lines from the separators
to the vacuum producer so as to have the friction loss from the
vacuum producer to each separator the same in order to
give uniform results at all inlets. This loss should also be<span class="pagenum" id="Page126">[126]</span>
kept as low as possible in order to prevent a high vacuum
in a separator serving a portion of the system on which few
sweepers are in operation. If low friction losses in the clean air
pipe will require larger pipes than it is practical or economical
to install, pressure reducing valves might be located in the
clean air pipes near the separators to so regulate the vacuum
at the separators and insure uniform results. A system of this
kind might serve several premises and the air used by each be
metered and the service sold much the same as heat and electricity.
However, the power required to operate the system
would be greater than that needed to operate a similar number
of sweepers by individual plants owing to the higher vacuum
required to overcome the friction in the trunk mains.
This would be offset by the use of larger units and the possibility
of operating them at full load at nearly all times. A
system of this kind was contemplated in Milwaukee some seven
years ago, but was never installed.</p>

<p>The appliances which remove the dust from the air current
which has carried it through the hose and pipe lines, in order
to prevent damage to the vacuum producer, play an important
part in the make-up of a vacuum cleaning system.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Classification of Separators.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">—Separators may be divided into
two classes according to their use:</p>

<p>1. Partial separators, which must be used in conjunction with
another separator in order to effect a complete removal of the
dust from the air. These separators are again divided into
two sub-classes, <i>i. e.</i>, primary, or those removing the heavy
particles of dust and dirt only, and secondary, or those removing
the finer particles of dirt which have passed through the
primary separator.</p>

<p>2. Complete separators, or those in which the removal of both
the heavy and the finer particles of dust is effected in a single
separator.</p>

<p>Separators may also be classified, according to the method
employed in effecting the separation, into dry separators in
which all operations are effected without the use of liquid, and
wet separators in which water is employed in the removal of
the dust.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Primary Separators.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">—Primary separators are nearly always
operated as dry separators and depend largely on centrifugal
force to effect the separation. The first type of primary separator
used by the Vacuum Cleaner Company is illustrated in
<a href="#Fig67">Fig. 67</a>. This consists of a cylindrical tank, with hopper bottom,
containing an inner cylinder fixed to the top head. The dust-laden
air enters the outer cylinder near the top on a tangent
to the cylinder. The centrifugal action set up by the air striking
the curved surface of the outer cylinder tends to keep the<span class="pagenum" id="Page128">[128]</span>
heavy dirt near the outside of same, and as it falls towards the
bottom the velocity is reduced and its ability to carry the dust
is lost. When the air passes below the inner cylinder the velocity
is almost entirely destroyed and all but the very lightest of
the dust particles fall to the bottom, while the air and the light
dust particles find their way out of the separator through the
opening in the center at the top.</p>

<p class="allclear">The separator illustrated in <a href="#Fig69">Fig. 69</a> was used by the General
Compressed Air and Vacuum Cleaning Company. The entering
air is led to the center near the bottom and is then released
through two branches curved to give the air a whirling motion.
The clean air is removed from the center of the separator near
the top. This separator is not as effective in its removal of dirt
as either of the former types, owing to the entering air
being introduced near the bottom. This tends to keep the air
and the dust in the bottom of the separator continually stirred
up, also the curved inlets give the air more of a radial than a
tangential motion and there is less separation due to centrifugal
action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page130">[130]</span></p>

<p>The separator illustrated in <a href="#Fig70">Fig. 70</a> is made by the Blaisdell
Engineering Company. In this separator the inner centrifugal
cylinder of the Vacuum Cleaner Company’s separator is replaced
by a spiral extending nearly to the outlet in the center
of the top. This arrangement tends to prevent the reduction in
the air velocity and to limit its effectiveness in the removal
of dust.</p>

<p>Separators similar to the Sanitary separator have been manufactured
by many firms producing vacuum cleaning systems.
These all differ somewhat in details of construction but the
principle involved, <i>i. e.</i>, centrifugal force and reduction in air
velocity, is the same in all cases.</p>

<p>With vacuum producers in which there are no close clearances
or rubbing contacts, these are the only separators used.
The finer particles of dust passing these separators are carried
harmlessly through the vacuum producer and through the exhaust
to the outer atmosphere or to the chimney or other flue
where they are effectively sterilized.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Secondary Separators.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">—With vacuum producers having
close clearances or rubbing parts in contact with each other and
the air exhausted, further separation of the finer dust particles
is necessary. To accomplish this, secondary separators are used.</p>

<p>All of the early systems used a wet separator as a secondary
separator. That used by the Vacuum Cleaner Company is illustrated
in <a href="#Fig71">Fig. 71</a>. It consists of a cylindrical tank partially
filled with water, with a diaphragm perforated in the central
portion and fixed in place below the water line, and an inverted
frustrum of a cone placed just above the water line. The air
enters the separator below the water line and passes up through
the water in the form of small bubbles which are broken up into
still smaller bubbles on passing through the perforations in
the diaphragm. This action is very essential to the thorough
cleansing of the air, as large bubbles of air may contain entrapped
dust which will pass through the water and out into
the vacuum producer. The inverted frustrum of a cone is intended
to prevent any entrained water passing out of the separator
with the air. This separator has always given satisfactory
results when used in connection with reciprocating pumps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page131">[131]</span></p>

<p>The separator illustrated in <a href="#Fig72">Fig. 72</a> was manufactured by the
General Compressed Air and Vacuum Cleaning Company. The
air enters the separator through the pipe curved downward and
escapes at the center below the water line. It then rises in the
form of bubbles and most of it strikes the under side of the
ribbed aluminum disc “a,” which is intended to float on the
surface of the water, and passes along the ribbed under surface
of this disc, escaping into the upper part of the separator around
the edge.</p>

<p class="allclear">The clean air passes out of the top of the separator to the
vacuum producer. The successful operation of this separator is
dependent on the freedom of motion of the disc “a,” which will
always keep it on the surface of the water, and on all of the
air passing up through the water under the disc.</p>

<p>Should the disc become caught on the supporting pipe the
violent agitation of the water, which occurs when the system
is in operation, will cause the disc to be left high and dry above
the water at times, and submerged at other times. When this
disc is above the water line it will not break up any of the
large bubbles. Also, when there is a large quantity of air passing
through the separator, there is great likelihood that considerable
of the air bubbles will pass up through the water entirely<span class="pagenum" id="Page132">[132]</span>
outside of the disc and these bubbles will not be broken
up. This separator has given somewhat unsatisfactory results in
some installations tested by the author.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The separator used by the Sanitary Devices Manufacturing
Company differs from those already described in that the air
and water are mixed before they enter the separator and the
air comes into the separator above the water line. The air enters
the pipe “a” (<a href="#Fig73">Fig. 73</a>) and passes to the aspirator “b,” which
is connected to the separator by the pipe “d” below the water
line and the pipe “e” above the water line. The excess of
vacuum in the separator draws the water out of the aspirator
and its pipe connections until the water line in this pipe
is lowered below the top of the horizontal portion of the
piping, when the air bubbles up through the demonstrator
glass “c” and passes into the separator through the pipe “e.”
The filling of the vertical pipe leading to “c” with air causes
the static head of the water in the separator to produce a flow
of water through the pipe “d” into the aspirator “b.” This
is formed in the shape of a nozzle and the water enters in the
form of a spray and thoroughly mixes with the air. The cleansing
action of this water spray has been found to be very
effective in removal of all fine dust and this separator has been
found to be the most effective wet separator ever produced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page133">[133]</span></p>

<p>While the wet separator when properly designed will effectively
remove the finest of dust, greasy soot will not emulsify with
the water and its removal is practically impossible. Fortunately,
this form of material in the finely-divided condition in
which it passes the primary separator is not gritty and does not
produce injurious effect on the vacuum producer.</p>

<p>The wet separator is also at a disadvantage in that there is a
loss of vacuum in passing through same equal to the head of
water that is carried between the inlet and the surface of the
water. This generally amounts to nearly 2 in. mercury.</p>

<p>Means must be provided to observe the height of the water
in the wet separator. For this purpose a glass window in the
side of the separator has been found to be the most effective.
The use of an ordinary gauge glass such as is used on boilers
has been tried, but it has been found that they readily become
so clouded by the action of the muddy water as to render them
useless while the constant agitation of the water against the
window when the system is in operation tends to keep the
glass clean.</p>

<p>Dry separators have been used for secondary separators to
a limited extent. All of these contained a bag made of canvas
or some other fabric. The separator illustrated in <a href="#Fig74">Fig. 74</a> contains
a bag made of drilling which is slightly smaller than the
inner diameter of the cylindrical casing of the separator. The
air enters the inside of the bag, inflating it, and passes through
the bag and out through the opening in one side of the casing.
A wire guard is placed over this opening to prevent the bag
being drawn against the opening and thus rendering only a
small portion of it effective.</p>

<p>These bags offer very little resistance to the passage of the
air when they are clean but they soon become filled with dust
and produce an increased resistance which, if neglected, may
result in so great a difference in pressure as to hinder the action
of the system and result in the rupture of the bag, letting the
dust into the vacuum producer.</p>

<p>Some trouble has been experienced in finding a suitable material
through which the dust will not pass. Hush cloth, such as
used on dining tables, has been found to be the best material<span class="pagenum" id="Page134">[134]</span>
for this purpose. Better results are obtained by passing the
air from the outside of the bag towards the inside than when
the air is passed as indicated in <a href="#Fig74">Fig. 74</a>. When this arrangement
is adopted, it is necessary to stretch the bag over a metal
screen or frame in order to prevent collapse.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Complete Separators.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">—Complete separators are of two classes,
<i>i. e.</i>, dry and wet. The first complete separator that the author
has knowledge of was used by the Vacuum Cleaner Company,
in the form of a cylindrical tank and contained centrifugal
cylinder and also a perforated plate. It was practically a combination
of the separators indicated in <a href="#Fig67">Figs. 67</a> and <a href="#Fig71">71</a>. This
separator was installed in connection with a small rotary pump
and mounted on a truck. It worked very well until it became
filled with dirt when, in one case, the entire contents were
ejected into an apartment in which it was being used. This
separator was then rebuilt in the form shown in <a href="#Fig75">Fig. 75</a>, the
bag being made of hush cloth stretched over a wire screen. The
air enters the cylinder tangentially and much of the separation<span class="pagenum" id="Page135">[135]</span>
is accomplished by centrifugal force, the remainder of the
dust being removed as the air passes through the bag. This
separator was successfully used as long as this company continued
to manufacture such apparatus.</p>

<p>Another form of complete separator quite similar to that
above described has recently been brought out by the Electric
Renovator Manufacturing Company and is shown in section in
<a href="#Fig76">Fig. 76</a>. The air enters this separator tangentially below the
line of the dust bag, which is made of muslin folded back and
forward over a set of concentric cylinders thus giving a large
area for the passage of the air. Being entirely above the line
of the entering air, none of the heavy dirt strikes the bag
and what dirt is caught on the bag is on the lower side of same
and is shaken off every time the bag is agitated. This agitation
occurs every time there is any change in the volume of air
passing the separator, and when these separators are used in
connection with fan type of exhausters there is a constant surging
whenever the exhauster is operated with a small volume of
air passing. This tends to keep the bag clean automatically.</p>

<p class="caption">FIG. 75. FORM OF COMPLETE SEPARATOR USED BY THE VACUUM
CLEANER COMPANY.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The separator illustrated in <a href="#Fig77">Fig. 77</a> is manufactured by the
American Radiator Company. The air enters this apparatus
through the pipe in the center and passes directly down to the
bottom, the velocity being gradually reduced due to the expansion
of the air as it passes down the cone-shaped inlet, the
heavy dirt falling to the bottom. The air then passes up along
the inner surface of the cylindrical shell and thence through the
bag, which is stretched over a screen, to the outlet. In this
separator we see the first case in which centrifugal action is not
utilized in separating the heavy dust, the makers evidently considering
the reduction of air velocity and the action of gravitation
to be ample. This bag is arranged to permit the air
passage from the outside towards the inside and it is tapered
to allow the dirt to fall off. The vacuum gauge is connected
to the inner and outer sides of the bag by means of a three-way
cock to permit of measuring the difference in vacuum between
the inside and outside of the bag to determine when the bag is
in need of cleaning, which is accomplished by a reversal of the
air current through the bag. This is quite necessary in order to
keep the separator always in an efficient condition.</p>

<p>A separator was devised by the Sanitary Devices Manufacturing
Company in which the bag was held extended by a wire
ring having a weighted rod passing out through the top of the
separator attached thereto. When the bag became clogged the
difference in pressure on the two sides would result in a tendency
of the bag to collapse and the rod would be raised up
out of the separator, indicating that cleaning was necessary,
which could be easily accomplished by drawing the rod up and
down a few times thus shaking the dust off the bag. This
separator never came into general use, although its arrangement
was ingenious and should have been easy to operate.</p>

<p>The great difficulty with all bags which must be cleaned
periodically is that they are almost universally neglected even
when there is a visual indicator to show the accumulation of
dirt, and when it becomes necessary to manipulate a three-way
cock in order to ascertain when this cleaning must be done it
will seldom if ever be attended to. A bag that will clean itself,
such as the Capitol Invincible, is shown in <a href="#Fig76">Fig. 76</a>.</p>

<p>The separator used by one manufacturer consists of a simple
cylindrical tank into which the air is blown tangentially, with
a screen near the top, the whole forming a base for the vacuum
producer. This separator does not remove any but the heaviest
dirt and is suitable for use only with a vacuum producer having
very large clearances and in locations where the discharge of
considerable dirt into the atmosphere is not objectionable.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Total Wet Separator.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">—The only total wet separator which
is in commercial use is manufactured by the American Rotary
Valve Company. This separator is contained in the base of the
vacuum producer and is provided with a screen near the point
of entrance of the dust-laden air, which screen is cleaned by a
mechanically-driven bristle brush. When the water in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page139">[139]</span>
separator becomes foul, the contents of the separator are discharged
direct to the sewer by means of compressed air. If
this separator receives proper attention it makes the most sanitary
arrangement that has been introduced in the vacuum
cleaning line to date. However, the separator should be emptied
at frequent intervals or the volume of solid matter contained in
the same will become so great that there will not be enough
water present to flush the sewer and stoppage is likely. These
separators are often neglected until the contents become of the
consistency of mortar or molasses which is not a fit substance
to discharge into a sewerage system.</p>

<p>There is still another form of apparatus used in connection
with vacuum cleaning systems which should be called an emulsifier
rather than a separator. That is the type used with the
Rotrex and the Palm systems. The dust is mixed with water
when it first enters the pump chamber, a screen being used to
remove the lint and larger particles of dirt and then the mud
produced by the combination of the dust and water is passed
through the pump along with the air. The air and muddy
water are separated on the discharge side of the vacuum producer.
In many cases where the exhaust pipe is long, there is
considerable back pressure on the discharge which is often sufficient
to force the seals in traps on the sewerage system, allowing
sewer gas to be discharged into the building in which the
cleaning system is installed. No means are provided for automatically
cleaning the screen used in these appliances and the
author knows of cases where the screen has become so completely
clogged with lint that its removal from the machine was
necessary in order to render the operation of the cleaning tools
possible.</p>

<p>When dry separators are used, the manual removal of the dry
dirt accumulated is necessary and is an objectionable as well as
unsanitary operation. The author considers that the ideal
arrangement of separator would be one in which the dirt can
all be emulsified with water and retained in the separator, only
the air passing through the vacuum producer, and in which the
contents of the separator would be discharged automatically to
the sewer when the density of this mixture becomes as heavy as<span class="pagenum" id="Page140">[140]</span>
will readily run through the sewer. This discharge should be
of sufficient volume to completely fill an ordinary house sewer
in order to insure a thorough flushing of the drain, and should
be discharged into the sewer under atmospheric pressure in
order to guard against the forcing of water seals in any of the
plumbing fixtures.</p>

<p class="caption">FIG. 77a. INTERIOR CONSTRUCTION OF DUNN VACUUM CLEANING
MACHINE.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>A separator of this type has recently been patented by E. D.
Dunn, originator of the Dunn Locke system. It is illustrated in
<a href="#Fig77a">Fig. 77a</a>. The action of the separator is as follows: After
starting the motor and turning on a small quantity of water,
a vacuum is produced in one tank and through a system of
piping to the cleaning implement in use. The dust and dirt
collected by the implement is saturated as it approaches the<span class="pagenum" id="Page141">[141]</span>
plant and in this saturated condition enters the bottom of a
body of water in the tank.</p>

<p>When the accumulating dirt and water reach a certain level a
valve is automatically operated which closes the tank’s communication
with the vacuum pump and allows its contents to flow
off to the sewer by gravity. The mechanism for operating the
valve is rather unique and includes a float which, on rising
with the water, makes a positive electrical contact, as shown
in the figure. In this illustration one tank is about to discharge
and the other tank is about to become operative. The
electrical contact causes the core of the magnet at O¹ to rise,
making the lever, K, turn over, which action opens one valve
and closes the other. In this way the tanks alternately partly
fill and empty their collections of water and sweepings.</p>

<p>This system has not as yet been in commercial use for
a sufficient length of time to insure its successful operation, and
the author does not consider the passing of dirt and water
through ordinary check valves to be commercially possible without
rendering these checks inoperative.</p>

<p>Check valves have been used where partial wet and dry
separators are operated in tandem to prevent drawing water
into the dry separator, in the event of the plant being shut
down with all inlets on the pipe line closed. In such a case,
the leakage through the pump into the wet separator may raise
the pressure in this separator faster than leakage on the pipe
line raises the pressure in the dry separator.</p>

<p>This is accomplished by providing a small connection between
the upper part of the two separators, fitted with a check valve
opening towards the dry separator. When the vacuum producer
is in operation, the vacuum in the wet separator is
approximately 2 in. greater than that in the dry and the check
is held closed. When the vacuum producer is stopped and the
vacuum in the wet separator falls faster than in the dry separator,
this check opens and clean air passes from the wet to
the dry separator. When operating under these conditions, the
action of the check valve is satisfactory. However, the author
has known of cases where the check leaked and when this happened
the check was immediately clogged by the dust-laden
air from the dry separator.</p>

the motion of the air through the system and that to
which the motive power is applied, namely, the vacuum producer.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Types of Vacuum Producers.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">—Vacuum producers can be
divided into general classes: 1. Displacement type, in which a
constant volume of air is displaced during each complete cycle
of operations of the machine, and 2. Centrifugal type, in which
the volume of air passing the producer during each complete
cycle of operations varies with the resistance to the passage of
such air through the system.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Displacement Type.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">—Under this head the piston and rotary
pumps are classed, and they are subdivided according to construction
into reciprocating and rotary, valved and valveless,
air cooled and water cooled.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Centrifugal Type.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">—Under this head the fan type of vacuum
producers are classed. They may be divided, according to
construction, into single stage and multi-stage, horizontal and
vertical.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Power Required to Produce Vacuum.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">—In order to ascertain
the efficiency of the various types of exhausters to be discussed
in this chapter it is necessary to ascertain the actual
power necessary to move one cubic foot of free air at any degree
of vacuum.</p>

<p>As nearly all machines tested by the author were driven by
electric motors and the power was, therefore, indicated in watts,
the curve C-D in <a href="#Fig78">Fig. 78</a> showing the actual power necessary to
exhaust one cubic foot of free air at the vacuum noted in the
lower margin, assuming no clearance and adiabatic compression,
is used as a basis for calculation of efficiency. This shows<span class="pagenum" id="Page143">[143]</span>
that to produce a vacuum of 8 in. mercury there will be required
an expenditure of 16 watts for each cubic foot of free
air exhausted, and to produce a vacuum of 12 in. mercury will
require an expenditure of 27 watts. If these quantities be
divided by the efficiency of the machine the actual power required
will be determined.</p>

USED AS A VACUUM PUMP.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<h3 class="inline"><b>Reciprocating Pumps.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">—The reciprocating pump was used
on the majority of the earlier vacuum cleaning systems. The
most common form in early use was a commercial air compressor
which was used as a vacuum pump without any change in its
construction. It was usually fitted with mechanically-operated
induction and poppet type of eduction valves of heavy pattern,
fitted with cushions of the dash pot principle, the same as are
used on air compressors working against terminal pressures
as high as 100 lbs. per square inch. The cylinders were water
jacketed to remove the heat of high compression. The valves in<span class="pagenum" id="Page144">[144]</span>
these compressors were heavy and required considerable pressure
to open them and the friction of the valve gear and other
moving parts, which were made heavy enough to withstand the
strains of high compression, was excessively high for a machine
where the compression did not exceed 8 or 9 lbs. per square
inch. Their efficiency, therefore, is lower under actual operating
conditions than if they were working against pressures for
which they were designed. A curve of the power consumption
of a 14-in. × 8-in. Clayton compressor is shown on <a href="#Fig78">Fig. 78</a>,
the abscissae being the vacuum in inches of mercury and the
ordinates of curve “AB” the watts required to exhaust one cubic
foot of free air. Curve “cd” represents the theoretical watts
required to do the same work. These compressors were used in
connection with systems operating with 1-in. hose and the
vacuum usually carried was 15 in. mercury. They require approximately
77 watts per cubic foot of free air at this vacuum
and the efficiency, shown in curve “ce” (<a href="#Fig78">Fig. 78</a>) is 46%.</p>

cubic foot and efficiency of this type of compressor are shown
in <a href="#Fig80">Fig. 80</a>. It will be noted that this compressor shows a better
efficiency than the air compressor at all degrees of vacuum and
it is the best reciprocating pump that the writer has ever tested.</p>

<p>This pump was made for several years without water jacket
and no trouble was ever experienced with overheating. However,
owing to the commercial air compressors being jacketed,
the makers using same made this a talking point and this company
was obliged to jacket its pumps.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The Vacuum Cleaner Company used a Clayton pump on its
smaller plants which was fitted with a semi-rotary valve in each
end serving as an induction and eduction valve, while the heavy
poppet eduction valve of the air compressor was dispensed with.
The increase in efficiency that should have resulted from this
change was not realized. The reason for this can be more
readily seen by inspection of the indicator cards, <a href="#Fig81">Figs. 81</a>
and <a href="#Fig82">82</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig81">Fig. 81</a> is a card taken from one of the Clayton compressors
fitted with combined induction and eduction valves, and <a href="#Fig82">Fig.
82</a> a card from a compressor with light steel induction and
eduction valves of the poppet type.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page146">[146]</span></p>

<p>It will be noted that the compression line, a-d, <a href="#Fig81">Fig. 81</a>, extends
above the atmosphere line, the pressure at the time of
opening the eduction valve being 4 lbs. per square inch above
the atmosphere. This is due to the failure of the mechanically-operated
valve to open soon enough. This valve being also the
induction valve, it is necessary for the eduction port to be closed
before the induction port can be opened, in order to prevent a
short circuit of air from the atmosphere into the separators.
This fact is responsible for the sudden increase in the pressure
at b, the eduction port having closed before the completion of
the stroke and the air in the clearance space being compressed
to 6¹⁄₂ lbs. above atmosphere. The induction port is not opened
until after the beginning of the suction stroke resulting in the
high degree of vacuum at c.</p>

<div class="container w40emmax" id="Fig81">

<p class="caption">FIGS. 81 AND 82. INDICATOR CARDS FOR CLAYTON AND MODIFIED
PUMPS.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>Compare this with the card, <a href="#Fig82">Fig. 82</a>. Here the compression
does not extend above the atmosphere line more than ¹⁄₄ lb.
per square inch and the eduction valve does not close until the
end of the stroke so that the vacuum at the beginning of the
suction stroke is no lower than during the entire stroke.</p>

<p>These pumps were working under the same conditions, <i>i. e.</i>,
15-in. vacuum in the separator. The M. E. P. for <a href="#Fig81">Fig. 81</a> is
7.05 while that in <a href="#Fig82">Fig. 82</a> is 6.7 and is higher than is usually
the case with this pump, due to the fact that the exhaust pipe<span class="pagenum" id="Page147">[147]</span>
from this pump was very long and crooked, a condition which
should be avoided whenever possible. Also, the pump from
which this card was taken is one of the older pattern and the
clearance was greater than in the later models. The point at
which the eduction valve opens in <a href="#Fig81">Fig. 81</a> is 53% of the stroke
and it closes at 95% of the stroke and is, therefore, open 42%
of the stroke, while in <a href="#Fig82">Fig. 82</a> the eduction valve opens at 46%
of the stroke and remains open to the end of the stroke, and,
therefore, is open for 54% of the stroke. Thus the pump with
the poppet valves will move more air at the same vacuum with
less expenditure of power than the pump with the mechanically-operated
valves.</p>

<p>Another type of reciprocating pump has been introduced in
the past two or three years in which a single valve which rotates
continuously in one direction is used for induction and
eduction valve, for both ends of the cylinder. This valve is a
plain cylindrical casting having ports cored through to alternately
connect the cylinder ports with the intake and exhaust
ports.</p>

<p>By rotating this valve 180° on its stem the vacuum pump
is changed to an air compressor. This arrangement is adopted
in order to discharge the contents of the separator into the
sewer as was explained in <a href="#Page3">Chapters I</a> and <a href="#Page127">VIII</a>. In this pump
there must be points at which both the induction and eduction
valves are closed at the same time and results similar to those
found with the semi-rotary valves of the Clayton pump will
naturally be in evidence. The author has endeavored to obtain
an indicator card from one of these pumps but has been unable
to do so. The effect of simultaneous closing of both induction
and eduction ports would naturally be more marked in
this pump than in the Clayton, as the motion of the valve in
this case is uniform at all times while the motion of the valve
gear of the Clayton pump is so arranged that the valve moves
very fast at the time that both ports are closed. One of the two
pumps of this type which was recently installed in the New
York Post Office is illustrated in <a href="#Fig83">Fig. 83</a>. These pumps have
a displacement of 1,200 cu. ft. each and are the largest reciprocating
pumps in use for vacuum cleaning at this writing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page148">[148]</span></p>

<p>An interesting property of the piston pump which lends
itself to the economical control of the vacuum in the system is
illustrated by the curve at the top of <a href="#Fig78">Fig. 78</a> which shows the
total power required to operate the Clayton type air compressor,
the efficiency of which is indicated by the lower curves
on this figure. The compressor was operated at constant speed
and the air volume varied to give various degrees of vacuum
from atmospheric pressure to a closed suction and the power
to operate the compressor read at intervals of two inches. The
current input to the motor in amperes is indicated by ordinates
and the vacuum in the separator by the abscissae. This indicates
that the piston pump requires the maximum power to
operate at about 15-in. vacuum and that the least power is required
when the vacuum is at the highest point possible to obtain.
The method employed in utilizing this characteristic of
a piston pump will be discussed in a later chapter.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Rotary Pumps.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">—The Garden City rotary pump is a good
example of the single-impeller type of pump and is or has
been used to some extent by at least two makers of vacuum
cleaning systems. Its interior arrangement is shown in <a href="#Fig84">Fig.
84</a>. A solid cylindrical impeller, A, is mounted eccentrically in
the cylindrical outer casing, the impeller being fitted with four
sliding vanes which are provided with distance pieces, E, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page149">[149]</span>
wearing faces, B. The oil reservoir is provided with a needle
valve which is automatically opened as soon as there is any
vacuum produced and closes automatically when the machine is
shut down. The rate of feed of oil is adjusted by the screw I.
This type of pump offers a large surface in rubbing contact
with the case and becomes very hot when in operation. It requires
liberal lubrication in order to prevent heating and cutting
of the surface of the casing. End wear in these pumps
causes leakage, and, as usually constructed, there are no means
provided for taking up this wear. It can be provided for,
however, by using metal shims on the ends of the cylindrical
casing.</p>

<p class="caption">FIG. 85. POWER REQUIRED TO OPERATE GARDEN CITY TYPE OF
ROTARY PUMP.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The power required to operate this type of pump (Curve a-b,
<a href="#Fig85">Fig. 85</a>), is nearly the same as that required to operate a piston
pump for vacuum less than 12 in. mercury, but when the vacuum
becomes higher, the power required becomes much greater than
that required by the piston pump. The efficiency (Curve c-e,
<a href="#Fig85">Fig. 85</a>), is identical with that obtained with the light-weight
poppet valve pump (Curve c-e, <a href="#Fig80">Fig. 80</a>) from 0 to 11 in.
vacuum, but for higher vacuum the efficiency of this type of
pump falls off, while the efficiency of the piston pump becomes
greater as the vacuum becomes higher. This difference in the
characteristics of the two types of pumps is due to the presence
of valves in one case and their absence in the other. With the
piston pump the atmospheric pressure reaches the cylinder
only while air is being discharged, the eduction valves being
closed at other times and a partial vacuum exists on both sides
of the piston. The higher the vacuum produced, the less time
there is atmospheric pressure on the piston until, when no air
is discharged, the air contained in the clearance space of the
cylinder is compressed and expanded, the compression and
expansion lines being coincident. The indicator card will have
no area, and the only power expended is that required to overcome
the friction in the moving parts. With the rotary pump
there are no discharge valves to hold the atmospheric pressure
from the discharge side of the impeller and the compression of
the rarified air is accomplished by the atmospheric pressure
admitting air through the eduction port into the chamber. As<span class="pagenum" id="Page151">[151]</span>
it comes opposite the eduction port there is no difference in the
time during which the impeller is subject to atmospheric pressure,
no matter what the quantity of air being discharged. The
higher the vacuum in the
spaces containing rarified air,
the greater the difference in
pressure on the opposite
sides of the sliding vane and,
therefore, the greater total
power required to turn the
rotor.</p>

<p class="caption">FIG. 86. ARRANGEMENT OF
DOUBLE-IMPELLER ROOT TYPE
ROTARY PUMP FOR VACUUM
CLEANING WORK.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>Another type of rotary
pump which is fast becoming
the most popular is the
double-impeller type. This is
generally known as the Root
blower, as the firm of this
name was the first to manufacture
same. They have
been in use for many years
as blowers for gas works, and
as vacuum producers for
various purposes, mainly the
operation of pneumatic tube
systems.</p>

<p>Why this form of vacuum
producer was not earlier
adopted in vacuum cleaning
systems, instead of the sliding-vane
type, is hard to
understand. This pump contains
two impellers or cams
which are mounted on shafts
geared together and revolve
in opposite directions inside
of a case, always being in
close proximity to the case and to each other, but never touching.
They are, therefore, frictionless in operation and the introduction<span class="pagenum" id="Page152">[152]</span>
of a small amount of water renders them practically air
tight. There being no metallic contact between the moving
parts, internal lubrication is unnecessary and there is no wear
on either the impellers or the casing and no means of taking
up wear are necessary.</p>

<p>The arrangement of the impellers and the method of providing
water to seal the parts is shown in <a href="#Fig86">Fig. 86</a>. A reservoir
containing water is provided on the discharge side of the pump
and a small pipe leads from this reservoir to the suction side of
the pump. The vacuum lifts water from the reservoir and discharges
same in a spray into the suction chamber. This water
passes through the pump and is separated from the air in the
discharge chamber to be returned to the suction chamber by the
vacuum. This operation will start automatically as soon as any
degree of vacuum is formed and will cease as soon as the pump
is shut down.</p>

<p>The power consumption and efficiency of this type of pump
are shown in <a href="#Fig88">Fig. 88</a>. The watts per cubic foot of free air
(Curve a-b) show a much lower consumption of power at the
lower vacuum than any of the pumps already tested. This is
probably due to the fact there is no internal friction. It will<span class="pagenum" id="Page154">[154]</span>
be noted that the power to operate at no vacuum is but 10
watts per cubic foot of free air, while all the others require
from 24 to 34 cubic feet. This also results in the efficiency
curve (c-e, <a href="#Fig88">Fig. 88</a>) reaching its maximum value at a lower
vacuum than in the case of the sliding vane pump (<a href="#Fig85">Fig. 85</a>).</p>

vacuum and is much higher than is obtained with any of the
other types of pumps at these vacua. When they are operated
at higher vacuum the efficiency is about the same as obtained
with the sliding vane pumps and lower than that obtained with
the reciprocating pumps. The best efficiency of this pump is
at the vacuum necessary to operate a cleaning system provided
with 1¹⁄₄-in. hose.</p>

<p>A slight modification of this type of pump is that used by the
Vacuum Engineering Company, known as the Rotrex. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page155">[155]</span>
pump has but one impeller, of nearly the same form as the
impellers in the Root blowers and has a follower driven by
crank and connecting rods which is always in close proximity
to the impeller but does not touch same. The arrangement of
this pump is illustrated in <a href="#Fig89">Fig. 89</a> which also shows the saturation
chamber and screens used instead of a separator, as explained

<h3 class="inline"><b>Centrifugal Exhausters.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">—This type of exhauster has always
taken the form of a fan. The first stationary fan type of exhauster
was manufactured by the Spencer Turbine Cleaner
Company. Their latest type is illustrated in <a href="#Fig90">Fig. 90</a>. It consists
of a series of centrifugal fans mounted on a vertical shaft,
stationary deflection blades being provided between the wheels<span class="pagenum" id="Page156">[156]</span>

<p>These centrifugal exhausters do not have a positive displacement,
as do all those already described, and therefore the variation
of the vacuum is not as much as in case of the positive
displacement machines. The vacuum produced when the machine
is moving no air is slightly less than the maximum that
the exhauster can produce and there is very little variation in
the vacuum with air quantities which can be moved without
exceeding the capacity of the motor or other means producing
the power. The curves showing the power required to operate<span class="pagenum" id="Page157">[157]</span>
and the efficiency of this type of vacuum producer are, therefore,
plotted with abscissae representing the air moved in
cubic feet per minute. The vacuum produced and the power
required to operate are plotted as ordinates. The curves for
the Spencer machine are shown in <a href="#Fig91">Fig. 91</a>. This curve is taken
from a four-sweeper machine and the vertical lines numbered
1 to 4 represent the conditions when that number of sweepers
are in operation; that is, bare floor renovators, with 50 ft.
of hose or 80 cu. ft. of free air per minute. The maximum
efficiency is reached at full load and is approximately 42%.
The vacuum at this efficiency is 5¹⁄₂ in. mercury, a drop of ³⁄₄-in.
from the maximum which was obtained at one-fourth load.</p>

<p>These machines have rather large clearances and a preliminary
separator is all that is required. They operate at a speed
of about 3,600 R. P. M. and the peripheral speed of the fans
varies from 15,000 to 22,000 ft. per minute. This produces<span class="pagenum" id="Page158">[158]</span>
some noise and considerable vibration and care must be exercised

<p>The machines made by the Electric Renovator Manufacturing
Company are horizontal and have much smaller clearances
than the Spencer machines. They operate at approximately
the same rotary and peripheral speed and are, therefore, as
noisy. However, the center of gravity of these machines is
lower and the vibration is not so great. The Spencer Company
is now making a horizontal machine which it furnishes only
when required, the claim for their vertical machine being that
the weight of the moving parts counteracts the thrust of the
atmospheric pressure against the fans and relieves the work of
the thrust bearings, at the expense of greater vibration. With
ball bearing thrusts, the author does not consider this to be of
great importance.</p>

<p>A view of the interior arrangement of the Invincible machine,
as manufactured by the Electric Renovator Manufacturing
Company, is shown in <a href="#Fig92">Fig. 92</a>.</p>

<p>These machines, when first made, were without valves and
the power consumption, vacuum and efficiency are shown in
<a href="#Fig93">Fig. 93</a>. It will be noted that the vacuum produced, when the
machine is operated at or below one-half load, is considerably
lower than is obtained at greater loads. This characteristic
produces a disagreeable noise when the machine is not handling
any air, evidently due to air rushing back through the outlet
when the vacuum tends to build up to the maximum which
occurs at intervals of about one-half second.</p>

<p>In order to overcome this trouble a valve has been fitted to
the discharge, as indicated at 4, <a href="#Fig92">Fig. 92</a>. With this valve in
place the power consumption, efficiency and vacuum are as<span class="pagenum" id="Page160">[160]</span>
shown in <a href="#Fig94">Fig. 94</a>. It will be noted that the vacuum is as high
at no load as at any load up to full load and is practically
constant. The efficiency at light loads is the same as before but
it is slightly lower at full load, being 50% without the valve
and 47% with the valve. This is due to the power being expended
in opening the valve for large quantities of air and to
friction in the valve passage.</p>

<p>A four-sweeper plant of this manufacture is shown in <a href="#Fig95">Fig.
95</a>. This plant is installed in the United States Post Office
at Los Angeles, Cal. The separate centrifugal separator,
shown at the left of the cut, is not used in the regular equipment
and was added in this case to fulfill the specification requirements.</p>

<p>A centrifugal pump with a single impeller is manufactured
by The United Electric Company and is known as the Tuec
system. A phantom view of the pump and separator is shown
in <a href="#Fig96">Fig. 96</a>. It will be noted that the shaft is vertical. However,
the vacuum is under the impeller in this case, and the
thrust due to the atmospheric pressure is down instead of up,
as in the case of the Spencer machines. This throws the weight
of the parts, plus the thrust due to atmospheric pressure, on
the thrust bearing. These machines do not produce a vacuum
greater than 3-in. mercury, and the additional thrust is not as
great as in the case of the machines producing higher vacuum,
the impeller being 24 in. in diameter, its area 450 sq. in. and
the thrust, with a vacuum of 3-in. mercury, 675 lbs., which
is worth considering. This downward thrust is partially counterbalanced
by mounting the armature of the electric motor
used to operate the fan, slightly below the magnetic center,
thereby causing an upward magnetic pull. These machines are
intended to be used with large hose and pipe lines to reduce
the friction to a very low point. When operating carpet renovators
the vacuum at the renovator rises to 1-³⁄₄-in. mercury and
the type of renovator used by them passes approximately 50
cu. ft. of air, while the bare floor renovators pass approximately
95 cu. ft. They are extensively used where bare floor work
is required, their first cost being low.</p>

<p>The results of tests of two of these machines of four-sweeper
capacity, driven by alternating and direct-current motors,<span class="pagenum" id="Page161">[161]</span>
respectively, are shown in <a href="#Fig96a">Fig. 96a</a>. These curves indicate a
considerably higher efficiency with the alternating than with
the direct-current motor. This is due to the low efficiency of
the special high-speed direct-current motors used with all centrifugal
fan-type exhausters. The alternating-current motors are
not so affected, in fact, the speed at which these fans are
operated is fixed by the requirements of the alternating-current
motors.</p>

as the Spencer machine. It will be noted that the vacuum produced

assuming that the feed water temperature was 32° F., the
vacuum to be maintained at 9 in. mercury at the aspirator.</p>

<p>Taking the results of the test of the three-sweeper nozzle as
an average, 0.066 lbs. of steam will be required to exhaust 1
cu. ft. of free air at 9 in. vacuum. The total heat in 1 pound
of dry steam at 110 lbs. gauge is 1187 B. T. U. and at<span class="pagenum" id="Page164">[164]</span>
212° F. the latent heat is 970 B. T. U. The factor of
evaporation, therefore, is 1.235, and the weight of steam at 110
lbs. allowed by the guarantee is 202 lbs. This amount of steam
will exhaust 3,060 cu. ft. per hour, or 51 cu. ft. per minute,
which is more than sufficient to operate a carpet renovator, and
is a little less than will pass through a bare floor brush attached
to the end of 50 ft. of 1 in. diameter hose, if the hose is
attached directly to the aspirator. With a line of pipe between
the hose cock and the aspirator, the air quantity will be somewhat
less, and this guarantee will undoubtedly be fulfilled in
every case.</p>

<p>The advisability of using an aspirator will depend on the
conditions to be met at the building in each case. Three typical
cases are cited below:</p>

<p><b>1. When there is a Generating Plant in the Building, and
a Plant Using 1¹⁄₄-in. Hose and 8-in. Vacuum is Desired.</b>—A
Root blower will require 27 watts for each cubic foot of air
exhausted (<a href="#Fig88">Fig. 88</a>), and the three-sweeper
aspirator, 0.065<span class="pagenum" id="Page165">[165]</span>
lbs. of steam. Then the pounds of steam required by the
aspirator to do the same work as one K. W. hour at the motor
of the Root blower will be</p>

<p class="formula"><span class="horsplit size100"><span class="topsplit">0.065 × 60</span>
<span class="botsplit">0.027</span></span> = 146.3</p>

<p class="noindent">The generating plant will produce a kilowatt hour at the switchboard
with not exceeding 60 lbs. of steam, and if the transmission
loss is 10% there will be required by the Root blower
not over 66 lbs. of steam to do the same work that takes 146
lbs. with the aspirator. This case would require that the Root
blower, driven by an electric motor, be used.</p>

<p><b>2. When there is High Pressure Steam Available, but no
Generating Plant.</b>—Then we may use either the aspirator or
a Root blower driven by a steam engine. This engine should
have an economy of 60 lbs. per indicated horse power, with not
over 15% friction loss, which will require 69 lbs. per brake
horse power. This will be equivalent to 69 × 0.776 = 90¹⁄₂ lbs.
per K. W. hour, which is still much better than 146 lbs. required
by the aspirator.</p>

<p><b>3. When Steam is Generated on the Premises with Coal
Costing $3.00 per ton and all Machinery Must be Driven by
Electricity Purchased for 5 Cents per K. W. Hour.</b>—Cost of
steam to do the same work in the aspirator that 1 K. W. hour
will do in a motor driving a Root blower is:</p>

<p class="formula"><span class="horsplit size100"><span class="topsplit">146 × 300</span>
<span class="botsplit">7 × 2240</span></span> = 2.8 cents</p>

<p class="noindent">as against 5 cents that would have to be paid for current. In
this case there would be a saving in using the aspirator, which
would not require as much attention as the motor, and at loads
less than full load, the steam used by the aspirator would be
in direct proportion to the load, as the control would shut the
steam off entirely during a portion of the time, while the motor
would require some current as long as it was in operation, even
if no air was being exhausted. On the other hand, the steam
which is exhausted from the aspirator is not suitable for use
in heating, as it is mixed with air and fine dirt, and must be
thrown away, a condition that must always be considered where
there is an opportunity to use exhaust steam for heating or
other purposes.</p>

<p>When the displacement type of vacuum producer of more
than one-sweeper capacity is used with a vacuum cleaning
system, some means must be employed to prevent the vacuum
rising above that necessary for efficient operation of the sweepers
when there are less renovators in use than the capacity of the
vacuum producer or when carpet renovators are in use on all
outlets.</p>

<p>If the displacement pump be run at constant speed, every
change in the quantity of air exhausted will cause a change
in the vacuum produced. This will result in inefficient operation
and may result in undue effort being necessary to operate
the renovator and in excessive wear on the carpets.</p>

<p>The earlier systems were not provided with any control and
the first attempt to control the vacuum was by placing a spring
relief valve on the pipe line near the separator, which admitted
additional air when the vacuum tended to rise. This resulted
in full load being thrown on the pump at all times when the
same was in use, which does not give economical operation.</p>

<p>The controllers that have been devised for maintaining a
constant vacuum without the introduction of air into the
system operate on one of three principles:</p>

<p>1. Closing the suction of the vacuum producer.</p>

<p>2. Opening the suction of the vacuum producer and holding
vacuum in the system.</p>

<p>3. Varying the speed of the vacuum producer.</p>

<p class="caption">FIG. 99. FIRST TYPE OF CONTROLLER
INTRODUCED BY THE
SANITARY DEVICES MANUFACTURING
COMPANY, KNOWN AS
THE “UNLOADING VALVE.”</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The first type of controller was introduced in the vacuum
cleaning field by the Sanitary Devices Manufacturing Company,
and was known as the “unloading valve.” It was similar to
the unloader which had been used for some time in connection
with air compressors. The detail of construction is shown in
<a href="#Fig99">Fig. 99</a>, and consists of a balanced valve, which is connected
to a weighted piston, operating in a chamber communicating
with the separators by a pilot valve. The pilot
valve is operated by an auxiliary piston which is weighted
to overcome the lifting effort due to the vacuum desired.
When the vacuum in the cylinder
becomes great enough to overcome
the weights attached to the auxiliary
piston, it rises, allowing
vacuum to reach the main piston,
which is drawn up and the suction
valve closed. When this valve
is closed the vacuum in the pump
at once starts to build up to the
maximum possible for the pump
to produce, and if the pump used
is of the piston type the vacuum
will run up to nearly 28 in., resulting
in the pump’s taking the
least power on which it can be
operated. As soon as the vacuum
in the separators falls below that
which will sustain the weight on
the auxiliary piston the valve falls
open and the pump again draws
air through the system. In actual
practice this valve will operate at
more or less frequent intervals.
The author timed the action of
one of these valves connected to
the suction of an eight-sweeper
piston pump, and its time varied
from ²⁄₅ second to 65 seconds.
The current taken by the pump
when the suction was open was 100 amperes at 220 volts. When
the valve was closed for but ²⁄₅ second the current dropped to
75 amperes, there not being sufficient elapsed time for the pump
to produce a perfect vacuum. When the valve was closed for<span class="pagenum" id="Page168">[168]</span>
2¹⁄₅ seconds, the vacuum reached its maximum value and the
current fell to 32 amperes.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig100">Fig. 100</a> is a curve plotted from the results of this test
and shows an increase in the power above that necessary to
overcome the friction in the moving parts of the pump in
direct proportion to the percentage of full load that the pump
was serving.</p>

<p class="caption">FIG. 100. TEST OF CONTROLLER CONNECTED TO SUCTION OF
8-SWEEPER PISTON PUMP.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>This is as near an ideal condition as one could expect to
obtain by any means other than stopping the pump or otherwise
decreasing the friction load. However, this form of
unloader is not suitable for a pump without valves, as the
power will increase with an increase in vacuum, and other
means must be employed to control such a pump.</p>

<p>The second form of control is adapted to this type of pump.
The arrangement of one of these controls is shown in <a href="#Fig101">Fig. 101</a>.
This consists of a single-ported valve opened by the vacuum
in the cylinder, M, the action of which is controlled by a pilot
or auxiliary control valve actuated by the vacuum in the separator.
This auxiliary valve is fitted with two pistons, S and<span class="pagenum" id="Page169">[169]</span>
O, which are held together by springs, and when so held the
main cylinder is open to the atmosphere through the small
ports in the piston, O. When the vacuum in the separator
becomes great enough to overcome the compressive strength of
the springs, T and P, the pistons, S and O, are drawn apart,
closing the port in the piston, O, and opening the port in piston,
S, allowing the vacuum to enter the main cylinder, M, and
open the main valve. This valve permits the atmospheric
pressure to enter the pump suction, the air being prevented
from entering the separators by a check valve, not shown. The
pump then operates without producing any vacuum, and the
power required to operate the pump is reduced. A relief valve
of the common vacuum-breaker type is shown at the left of
the cut. This valve is provided to prevent overload in case the
control fails to operate.</p>

<p class="caption">FIG. 101. TYPE OF CONTROLLER FOR USE ON PUMPS WITHOUT
VALVES.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>This type of control does not effect as great a reduction in
the power as the first type of control described, since it requires
a greater per cent. of the full load power to operate the pump
at no vacuum than at perfect vacuum. No air is moved in the
latter case, and the maximum volume of air is moved in the
former case.</p>

<p>Either of these controls gives fairly economical results when<span class="pagenum" id="Page170">[170]</span>
the pump is serving at least a part of the sweepers at all times.
However, when the system is used in a building where there
may be cleaning done at any time and vacuum must be “on
tap” at all times, as in a hotel, there will be many occasions when
no sweepers will be in use, and the pump might then be stopped
entirely, provided that it could be automatically started when
needed.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>Where the steam aspirator is used, the control (<a href="#Fig97">Fig. 97</a>) is
attached to the steam supply valve. When the valve is closed
no steam is consumed by the aspirator. This is the ideal condition
where we must keep vacuum “on tap,” and is a characteristic
of the aspirator system which has led to its introduction
in many instances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page171">[171]</span></p>

<p>The same economy can be obtained with a steam-driven
pump by inserting a throttle valve, controlled by the vacuum
in the separators, which will start and stop the engine driving
the pump and vary its speed in accordance with the quantity
of air required by the system.</p>

<p>Several appliances for varying the speed of a motor-driven
vacuum pump have been placed on the market, the simplest
and probably the best of these appliances being that manufactured
by the Cutler Hammer Manufacturing Company, illustrated
in <a href="#Fig102">Figs. 102</a> and <a href="#Fig103">103</a>.</p>

<p class="caption">FIG. 103. INSPIRATOR TYPE VACUUM CONTACTOR, USED TO CONTROL
PILOT MOTOR OF CUTLER-HAMMER CONTROLLER.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>The object of the apparatus shown in <a href="#Fig102">Fig. 102</a> is to automatically
start a motor-driven vacuum pump and control the
speed of the motor so that the vacuum is maintained at the
desired degree, irrespective of variation in the number of
sweepers in use. This control of the degree of variation is
accomplished in a more efficient manner than if the pump were
to be driven at its maximum speed at all times and the pressure
kept at the desired point by means of a blow-off or by-pass
valve. With this system a motor is used having a control, by
shunt field weakening, of approximately 3:1 in order that the
control of the speed may be as efficient as possible.</p>

<p>Referring to <a href="#Fig103">Fig. 103</a>, a small pilot
motor is mounted<span class="pagenum" id="Page172">[172]</span>
on brackets at the side of the panel, driving directly, through
an insulating coupling, a screw shaft which carries a traveling
cross-head. This cross-head is shown in the photograph at the
extreme right of its travel, which corresponds to the maximum
speed of the motor, the left-hand end corresponding to zero
speed of the motor. In this position the motor circuit is opened
by the clapper type magnetic switch. Assuming that the cross-head
is in the extreme left-hand position and the knife switch
is closed, the pilot motor will be started in such a direction as
to move the cross-head to the right. A slight movement in this
direction completes a connection to the magnetic switch, which
thereupon closes the motor circuit through all of the resistance,
starting the pump motor.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as the pilot continues to move the cross-head
toward the right, the speed of the pump will be gradually
increased until, at a point about midway of its travel, all of
the resistance in the armature circuit of the motor will have
been cut out upon the upper segments and further movement
then serves to weaken the field. This is accomplished by means
of the contact buttons shown just below the screw shaft.</p>

<p>As soon as the cross-head has weakened the field to its minimum
value and thus speeded the motor up to its maximum
point, a limit switch stops the pilot motor and thus prevents
further motion in that direction. As soon as the pump working
this at its maximum speed has produced a vacuum in the
cleaning system of, say, 12 in. of mercury, the cross-head will
begin to move backward and reduce the speed to a point corresponding
with the air required.</p>

<p>This control of the pilot motor is accomplished by means of
what is termed “inspirator type vacuum contactor.” This
apparatus is shown more in detail in <a href="#Fig103">Fig. 103</a>, and consists of
a diaphragm closing one side of a chamber. The diaphragm
is pressed outward by an internal spring whose tension may
be adjusted by means of a hexagonal head cap screw, visible
in the photograph of the complete regulator.</p>

<p>The diaphragm is coupled to a pivoted arm carrying insulated
conical-pointed silver screws, so located that they enter
holes in small silver plates mounted on opposite sides, respectively,<span class="pagenum" id="Page173">[173]</span>
of the upper and lower contact posts. These contact
posts are hollow and communicate with the diaphragm chamber,
which latter is connected by piping to the vacuum system.</p>

<p>Normally, the internal spring forces the diaphragm over so
that the lever makes contact with the lower post. This serves
to drive the pilot motor in a direction to move the cross-head
to increase the speed of the pump. When the degree of vacuum
for which the apparatus is adjusted is reached the lever starts
to move toward the left hand, and in so doing stops the pilot
motor. This maintains the pump speed at that particular value.
Should the vacuum increase to a sufficient degree the lever
will be drawn further over toward the left and contact will
then be established with the upper post, which will cause the
pilot motor to move the cross-head to the left, and thus decrease
the pump motor speed.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as the motion of the diaphragm lever is very gradual,
destructive arcing would take place at the pilot motor contacts
were it not for the small openings in the silver contact
plates, which, as the pointed screw leaves the hole, immediately
sucks the arc inward and extinguishes it.</p>

<p>This method of preventing arcing is exceedingly unique and
is subject to patents now pending.</p>

<p>It is possible to adjust the high and low limits by changing
the setting of the pointed silver screws, the usual adjustments
being such as to maintain the vacuum within 2 in. of mercury.
The speed of the pilot motor may be adjusted by means of
the small link shown in the upper left-hand corner of the panels
to correspond with the capacity of the system, it being found
that systems of large capacity require a slower motion than
those in which the amount of piping, etc., is less for the same
size of pump. In practice, the regulator will very quickly find
the position corresponding to the proper speed for the number
of outlets in use, and only moves a slight amount either side
of this particular position.</p>

<p>With this regulator it is possible to employ remote control
permitting the establishment of vacuum in the piping system
by the turning of a pilot switch located at any point in the
building. If desired, several such switches may be placed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page174">[174]</span>
parallel, and, under these conditions, the turning on of any
switch will establish the vacuum supply which will be maintained
until all of the pilot switches are turned off. By this
means it is possible to have several janitors working at the
same time on different floors of the building, and each will be
independent of the others in his control of the vacuum; although
one man may finish and turn off the switch on his floor,
the pump will not be stopped if the vacuum is still required by
workers on other floors.</p>

<p>When the total size of one installation becomes greater than
25 H. P., it is found desirable to provide two pumping units,
and, in this case, the same system is applicable. The cross-head
is then arranged to start first one pump and increase its
speed to a maximum. If this does not supply the necessary
amount of air, the cross-head continues to move, and starts the
second pump, which will then be run at a necessary speed to
supply the remaining amount of air.</p>

<p>The first pump always remains in motion at its point of
highest efficiency. It is evident that this duplex arrangement
is more efficient than one large pump when only a very few
sweepers are in operation, since, for this condition, the very
large pump would have to be run at such a slow speed that the
armature resistance would be in circuit, while the single smaller
pump would be running at a more efficient speed and with less
proportionate motor losses.</p>

<p>In duplex outfits switches are provided for disconnecting
either motor in case of its being necessary to clean or repair
either unit. When so disconnected the other unit may be operated
and maintain the same degree of vacuum within the limits
of its capacity.</p>

<p>While this type of control is more economical in current consumption
than either of the former types described, its cost is
much higher, and it is seldom used unless specifically ordered.</p>

<p>When the centrifugal type of vacuum producers is used no
control is necessary, as the inherent feature of this type of
apparatus insures a practically constant vacuum at all air quantities
within the capacity of the machine.</p>

<span class="smcap">Scrubbing Systems.</span></h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>Vacuum cleaning systems in which appliances for scrubbing
are provided in addition to the usual appliances for the removal
of the dust and other materials in a dry state have been introduced
by a few manufacturers, none of which has come into
general use.</p>

<p>The usual method employed is to provide an ordinary corn
scrubbing brush which has a connection to the water supply of
the building, with control valves in the tool handle for regulating
the flow of water to the brush. Soap is applied either in
the form of soap powder sprinkled on the floor, in a liquid
state fed into the water supply by means of a sight-feed oil cup
or soft soap in a plastic state fed into the water supply by means
of a compression grease cup.</p>

<p>In any case, the water is run onto the floor mixed with the
soap and the floor scrubbed by manipulating the corn brush,
in the same manner that an ordinary corn scrubbing brush
without attachments would be used.</p>

<p>After the dirt has been loosened from the floor, the floor may
be rinsed by the application of more water. The water is then
drawn up from the floor by the suction of the cleaning machine,
and passes through the hose and piping system to the separator
and vacuum producer. To effectively remove the water a rubber-faced
tool is usually employed. In one system this rubber face
is arranged to permit the corn brush to be fitted over same
when scrubbing is being done, and the brush must be removed
from the tool before the water can be drawn up from the floor.
Other manufacturers provide a double-faced tool having the
brush on the opposite side of the tool from the rubber-faced
slot. By reversing the tool, scrubbing and mopping can be
accomplished without the removal of the corn brush from the
tool, which is more convenient for the operator.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page176">[176]</span></p>

<p>With either of the above forms of scrubbing tools it is necessary
or desirable to cut off the suction to the mopping attachment
when using the corn brush, and it is also necessary to
cut off the water supply to the brush when using the mopping
attachment. One system, introduced several years ago, conducted
the water to the brush and away from the rubber-faced
mopping appliance through the same hose. This arrangement
requires the use of a special three-way hose cock, which had to
be manipulated frequently during the scrubbing operation,
requiring the time of another person in addition to the operator,
or else greatly delaying the scrubbing process by requiring the
operator to constantly pass back and forth between the hose
cock and the scrubbing tool. This method of supplying water
also requires the use of a removable corn brush attached over
the rubber mopping device.</p>

<p>Other forms of scrubbing appliances are provided with separate
hose for the water supply and suction and with valves
in the handles for controlling the suction and water supply.
These valves to be efficient and quick in action are generally
made self-closing, otherwise they will be short-lived, as
explained in <a href="#Page70">Chapter V</a>. When springs are used to close the
valves, the hand and wrist will be quickly fatigued, as stated
in <a href="#Page70">Chapter V</a>.</p>

<p>With either of the above systems all of the scrubbing, that
is, the agitation of the brush, has to be performed by the operator,
as in the case of the ordinary scrubbing brush. However,
the combination tool is much heavier and clumsier than the
ordinary scrubbing brush, and the only advantage obtained by
using this heavy and clumsy appliance is the ability to supply
water without carrying it in buckets, also the removal of the
dirty water after scrubbing. These appliances cannot be termed
mechanical scrubbers, nor can they be classed with scrubbing
machines with motor-driven brushes, such as have been recently
introduced.</p>

<p>A real mechanical scrubbing device for use with a vacuum
cleaning system was manufactured by Foster &amp; Glidden, of Buffalo,
N. Y., but was never placed on the market, although at
least one is in commercial operation to-day. This machine is<span class="pagenum" id="Page177">[177]</span>
provided with a turbine motor operated by the air current
passing through the machine. This turbine revolves a pair of
scrubbing brushes turning in opposite directions. Water is fed
through a separate hose, and an auxiliary air inlet is opened
when the suction under the brushes is closed, in order to supply
the necessary air to keep the turbine running. Mr. Foster
states that he has experienced no trouble in operating this
machine on from 8 in. to 12 in. of vacuum, being able to scrub
and remove the dirt and water with one operation. The speed
with which the work was done depended on the condition of the
floor, the usual rate, as given by Mr. Foster, being from 10 to
12 yds. per minute.</p>

<p>Mr. Foster also states that he has not pushed the introduction
of this scrubber, as he considers it so far ahead of the times as
to require the education of the public in the use of the hose
and ordinary vacuum cleaning tools before users would be
capable of successfully operating this type of scrubber.</p>

<p>The author considers this condition to be lamentable if true,
for until some such appliance is in commercial use scrubbing
attachments to a vacuum cleaning system can never compete
with the mechanical scrubbing machines now on the market,
and are little if any better than the old method of scrub-brush,
mop and pail, and certainly not as rapid in operation.</p>

<p>When the vacuum cleaning systems combine scrubbing with
dry cleaning, the separator and vacuum producer must provide
for the removal of water as well as air. A few manufacturers
have attempted this, among which are the makers of the
Rotrex system, described in <a href="#Page142">Chapter IX</a>, in which the water
is passed through the pump and into the sewer under sufficient
pressure to overcome the friction in the exhaust pipe through
which the expelled air passes after leaving the separator. This
may be sufficient to force the trap seals of the plumbing system,
and, if used, the discharge connection should be made to the
sewer outside the main running trap, close to the fresh air
inlet. As large articles cannot be allowed to pass through the
pump, a screen is necessary on the inlet side of the vacuum
producer, but this may give trouble, due to the clogging with
litter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page178">[178]</span></p>

<p>The Atwood Vacuum Cleaner Company uses a wet tank on
the suction side of the vacuum producer into which the dirt
and water are discharged, the air being separated and passed to
the vacuum producer. When this tank becomes partly filled
it is necessary to shut down the plant and empty the contents
of the tank by gravity into the sewer.</p>

<p>This method overcomes the objections to clogged screens and
forced trap seals, and all litter is discharged direct to the sewer,
together with a quantity of water which is presumably sufficient
to flush the litter through the sewer. The last named system is
still open to two objections; first, it is not automatic, and, if
neglected, the tank will fill with water and force same into the
vacuum producer. With the Root type of vacuum pump this
will do little harm unless a large quantity of floating litter
should pass into the pump. Second, the system may be operated
with dry renovators exclusively for a considerable portion
of the time, in which case the contents of the separator may
become of such a consistency as will not readily flush through
the sewer, and stoppage of the same may occur.</p>

<p>Another separator of this type has recently been patented by
E. B. Dunn, the originator of the Dunn Locke, in which the
mud and the water are automatically discharged alternately
from one of two separators, as described in <a href="#Page127">Chapter VIII</a>.</p>

<p>Such a separator, in which sufficient water is automatically
introduced to dilute the dirt and which will automatically
empty when sufficiently filled, when so constructed that it will
operate continuously, is considered to be the ideal separator for
use with a combined cleaning and scrubbing system. Until the
mechanical scrubber and an automatically operated separator
are commercially introduced the author does not consider that
the use of scrubbing attachments, in connection with the vacuum
cleaning system, is advisable.</p>

<span class="smcap">Selection of Cleaning Plant.</span></h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>We have considered in detail the various appliances which,
taken together, make a complete vacuum cleaning system, but
without considering their relation to one another. It now becomes
necessary to choose an exact type and form of each of
these appliances which will produce in combination a complete
vacuum cleaning system best suited to the conditions to
be met in a given installation.</p>

<p>In selecting a vacuum cleaning system consideration must be
given to the character of the material to be removed, the kind
and quality of the surfaces to be cleaned, the rate at which
cleaning must be done, the extent of the cleaning system, and
the cost of labor to operate the system, all of which must be
considered in each step in the selection of a suitable plant.</p>

<p>In assembling the complete system, the author will take up
the various parts thereof in the order in which they were discussed
in the preceding chapters.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Renovators.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">—The selection of renovators is the most important
step in making up a vacuum cleaning system, as the entire
makeup of the system, whether good or bad, is dependent on
the proper selection of these tools. The carpet renovator is
generally considered first in importance, because the cleaning
of carpets has nearly always been found to be the principal field
of usefulness in vacuum cleaning work. This is due, perhaps,
largely to the fact that from the beginning of the art of vacuum
cleaning, this function of the system has been held before the
eyes of the public by the manufacturers of the earlier systems.
Nearly all demonstrations of cleaning systems shown to the
public consist of the removal of ordinary wheat flour from a
carpet. The reason for this is two-fold; first, because it is
the most striking demonstration to the eye of the layman, and,
second, it is the easiest to accomplish with a small air displacement<span class="pagenum" id="Page180">[180]</span>
and small power, which was characteristic of the apparatus
made by these manufacturers.</p>

<p>The author was at one time of the opinion that this function
of the cleaning plant was given too much prominence by
builders of systems having small air displacement, and letters
were sent to the officials in charge of sixteen Government
buildings in which vacuum cleaning systems were installed,
asking them, among other questions, whether the cleaning system
was used to any extent in cleaning bare floors, of which
there were large areas, both wood and marble, in the buildings
in question. The plants installed were of various makes, some
of which maintained 12 in. mercury at the separator and used
1-in. hose, while about an equal number of others maintained
6 in. mercury at the separator and used 1¹⁄₂-in. hose. The
answers showed that out of the sixteen buildings the cleaner
was used on bare floors in but two of the buildings. One
writer, who had a plant maintaining 6-in. vacuum, provided
with Type F renovators and 1¹⁄₂-in. hose, stated that he had
tried cleaning bare floors without success, as the renovator and
hose became so clogged with litter as to be inoperative. The
majority stated that the cleaning system displaced brooms on
carpets and rugs and several stated that the cleaning system
was used to advantage in cleaning walls, cases, pigeon holes
and relief work.</p>

<p>This indicates that for the average office and departmental
building the cleaning of carpets is the most important function
of the vacuum cleaner. This is also true of residence work.
Schools, department stores and manufacturing buildings contain
very little floor space covered with carpets, and in buildings
of this character the cleaning of bare floors is of the greatest
importance. In such cases the efficiency of the carpet renovator
can be sacrificed to a more efficient and economical operation of
bare floor renovators.</p>

<p>In a building where carpet cleaning is an important function
of the cleaning system, the selection of the carpet renovator is
most important. Of all the various types of carpet renovators
discussed in <a href="#Page25">Chapter III</a>, only two need to be considered, Type
A and Type F. Of these, Type A is superior in all respects<span class="pagenum" id="Page181">[181]</span>
except the picking up of large litter, and, unless the character
of the material to be removed contains a large amount of material
which can be picked up by Type F renovator that will not
pass Type A, Type A renovator should always be used. Even
when Type F renovators are desirable, the writer considers that
the plant should still contain some Type A renovators for use
in places where this unusual litter will not be encountered.</p>

<p>Among the bare floor renovators, described in <a href="#Page60">Chapter IV</a>,
only the one having a felt face, curved to permit its running
over the dirt, is worthy of serious consideration. This renovator
requires an inlet or vacuum breaker to keep same from sticking
to the surface cleaned, the extent of such opening being
dependent on the vacuum maintained in the carpet renovators,
as explained in <a href="#Page100">Chapter VII</a>.</p>

<p>When carpet cleaning is considered as of secondary importance
to bare floor cleaning, the degree of vacuum maintained
at the separators may be reduced to that which will produce a
vacuum of 1 in. mercury at the bare floor renovator, allowing
the vacuum maintained at the carpet renovator to be whatever
the conditions of hose and pipe line will produce. Under
such conditions, the area of the inrush or vacuum breaker in
the bare floor renovator may be reduced considerably.</p>

<p>The use of brush renovators is dependent on the capacity of
the air exhauster supplied, as explained in <a href="#Page80">Chapter VI</a>. If it
is decided that brush renovators are necessary, then the “large
volume” exhauster must be installed. The advisability of such
installation is dependent on the time allowed for cleaning and
the cost of the operators. In residences and small buildings
where the cleaning operations can be done with one or even
two domestics or laborers, very little, if any, saving in the wages
of operators can be effected by increasing the rate at which the
cleaning can be done. In such buildings a small-volume plant
will be the most economical in first cost and operation. If such
a plant is installed, the brush renovators should be omitted.</p>

<p>In cases where bare floor cleaning is the principal function
of the cleaning system the extra quantity of air at the low
vacuum necessary will not require much larger expenditure of
power than that needed by the small-volume plants when<span class="pagenum" id="Page182">[182]</span>
maintaining sufficient vacuum for effective carpet cleaning and
brush renovators should be provided with systems of this character.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Hose.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">—In <a href="#Page80">Chapter VI</a> it is shown that when carpet renovators
are operated efficiently in combination with bare floor
renovators, 1¹⁄₄-in. hose will produce the best results with the
lowest expenditure of power at the hose cock. In <a href="#Page100">Chapter VII</a>
it is shown that with pipe lines of ordinary length 1¹⁄₄-in. hose
also gives the best results, with the least expenditure of power
at the separator, but that in cases of exceedingly long pipe
lines, 1-in. hose will be the most economical. In a system where
bare floor cleaning is the principal function, the vacuum to
be maintained at the carpet renovator is no longer considered,
and for such systems the largest hose which can easily be handled
will cause the least hose friction and require the lowest
vacuum at the hose cock. It is, therefore, the most economical
to use on such a system. The author does not recommend the
use of a hose larger than 1-³⁄₄-in. diameter for this type of
plant.</p>

<p>The proper hose sizes, therefore, will be: For ordinary
buildings where carpet cleaning is important, 1¹⁄₄-in. diameter.
For installations with unusually long lines of piping, where
carpet cleaning is important, 1-in. diameter.</p>

<p>For all systems where carpet cleaning is of secondary importance,
1¹⁄₂-in. or 1-³⁄₄-in. diameter.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Pipe Lines.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">—Pipe lines should always be as large as possible
without reducing the velocity in same below 40 ft. per
second, as explained in <a href="#Page100">Chapter VII</a>.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Separators.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">—The type of separator to be used is dependent
on the type of vacuum producer adopted. Where reciprocating
exhausters are used, or other type of exhauster where there is
rubbing contact between the moving parts and the dust, the
combination of a wet and dry separator is recommended. When
rotary or centrifugal exhausters having close clearances are
used, total separators with bags are recommended. When exhausters
with large clearances are operated, partial separators
are satisfactory.</p>

<p>The use of any form of apparatus contemplating the adoption<span class="pagenum" id="Page183">[183]</span>
of a satisfactory scrubbing system is not considered advisable,
as the author believes that separators for handling water will be
improved before scrubbing becomes commercially successful.
Changes in the existing separators can be made when satisfactory
scrubbing appliances are placed on the market, at no
greater expense than would be necessary to bring up to date
any of the present systems for handling water.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Vacuum Producers.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">—The selection of the vacuum producer
is dependent on the degree of vacuum that must be maintained
to effectively operate the system selected. For the operation of
a system where carpet cleaning is the principal function and
1¹⁄₄-in. hose is used, the vacuum required at the producer will
be from 6 in. to 9 in. mercury. Inspection of the efficiency
curves of the various types of vacuum producers, given in
<a href="#Page142">Chapter IX</a>, shows that the two-impeller rotary pump has the
highest efficiency at this vacuum.</p>

<p>For the operation of systems where carpet cleaning is the
most important function and 1-in. hose is found to be the most
economical, 14 in. to 15 in. of vacuum at the vacuum producer
is necessary, and efficiency curves, given in <a href="#Page142">Chapter IX</a>, show
that the piston pump is the best suited for such service.</p>

<p>For the operation of a system where carpet cleaning is of
secondary importance a vacuum at the producer of from 2 in.
to 4 in. of mercury will be sufficient. For this work, the multi-stage
or even single-stage centrifugal fan is practically as efficient
as the two-impeller rotary, and will be lower in first cost
and cost of maintenance. Either of the above mentioned vacuum
producers are satisfactory for operating a system of this type.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Control.</b></h3>

<p class="hinline">—Every system of more than one-sweeper capacity
in which a displacement type of exhauster is used should be
provided with some means of economically controlling the
vacuum at the producer. On one-sweeper plants an automatic
starter which will stop the motor when the vacuum reaches a
point 2 in. above that required and start same when the vacuum
drops to 1 in. below that required is convenient, but not
necessary.</p>

<p>For piston pumps and all other displacement pumps fitted
with eduction valves, an unloading device, which closes the<span class="pagenum" id="Page184">[184]</span>
suction when the necessary vacuum is exceeded, is the least
expensive to install and gives very good economy when the
demand on the plant is fairly continuous during the time it is
in operation. Where the service is intermittent and required
at nearly all hours, the Cutler Hammer control, described in
<a href="#Page166">Chapter X</a>, is the most economical.</p>

<p>With displacement exhausters having no eduction valves,
the by-pass type of control is satisfactory where the service
is continuous, but is not as economical, as the unloader used
with producers having eduction valves and the Cutler Hammer
control is more efficient under all conditions of service. Centrifugal
exhausters need no control, as vacuum control is an
inherent feature of these machines.</p>

<p>Summing up the subject, we can divide the vacuum cleaning
systems into four classes, each of which requires a different
selection of appliances. They are as follows:</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Class 1.</b></h3>

<p>It is interesting to note that to produce the most efficient
plant for all of the four cases named, all of the various types
of vacuum cleaning systems which have come into general use
have to be operated each under its most favorable conditions
and the engineer should select his plant to best fulfill the conditions
of the special case at hand, just as he would select his
prime mover for an electric generating plant according to its
size and location. There should be no more reason why any
one of these systems should attempt to fulfill the requirements
of every installation than there would be for a manufacturer
of steam engines to attempt to use the same type of engine to<span class="pagenum" id="Page186">[186]</span>
drive a generator under all conditions. The writer believes that
this condition will soon be realized by all manufacturers of
vacuum cleaning systems and that they will endeavor to install
apparatus of the type best suited to the conditions to be met in
each case.</p>

<span class="smcap">Tests.</span></h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>Having decided on the type of vacuum cleaning system that
is best suited to the conditions of the particular building in
which it is to be installed, it then becomes necessary to ascertain
what are the tests necessary to determine whether the
installation will produce the desired results.</p>

<p>If the installation is one in which carpet cleaning is important
and the plant is of more than one-sweeper capacity, the
exhauster must be of sufficient capacity to produce a vacuum of
not less than 4 in. mercury at a carpet renovator attached to
any inlet on the piping system, when the plant is operating
other renovators of any type attached to any of the other inlets
corresponding to one less than the total sweeper capacity of the
system.</p>

<p>When hose lengths as short as 25 ft. can be used on any or
all of the outlets, it has been demonstrated in <a href="#Page100">Chapter VII</a> that
an air removal of 70 cu. ft. of free air per minute for each
sweeper of plant capacity is necessary, no matter what size of
hose is used. It was also shown that where pipe lines are very
long and it is possible to always use 100 ft. of hose, efficient
cleaning can be done with less expenditure of power with an
air displacement of 45 cu. ft. of free air for each sweeper of
plant capacity.</p>

<p>Many methods have been recommended for testing a cleaning
plant. Perhaps the earliest was the maintaining of 15 in. of
vacuum at the vacuum producer with carpet renovators each
attached to 100 ft. of hose, equal in number to the sweeper
capacity of the plant in operation on carpets. Another test is
to attach 100-ft. lengths of hose to inlets on the system, with
the ends wide open, equal in number to the sweeper capacity
of the plant, and require the pump to maintain a vacuum of
15 in. mercury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page188">[188]</span></p>

<p>Both of these tests were recommended for use on plants
where 1-in. diameter hose was provided and the results are
dependent largely on the size and length of the piping system.
With an average-sized system, the first test will require an
exhaustion of approximately 25 cu. ft. of free air per renovator
per minute if Type A renovators are used. The second test
wall require an exhaustion of approximately 50 cu. ft. of free
air per open hose per minute. Neither of these tests will
insure a plant of sufficient capacity to do effective cleaning
where 25-ft. lengths of 1-in. hose can be used or if larger bore
than 1-in. hose be used.</p>

<p>If these tests are required with bores larger than 1-in. diameter
and the vacuum is maintained the same as before, air exhaustion
with 1¹⁄₄-in. open hose will be approximately 70 cu. ft.
of free air per open hose, and with 1¹⁄₂-in. hose, approximately
150 cu. ft. per open hose, while, if carpet renovators be used,
the vacuum at the renovator would be from 7 to 9 in. of mercury.
In either case, the vacuum required to be maintained at
the separators is higher than is necessary to produce economical
cleaning with either 1¹⁄₄-in. or 1¹⁄₂-in. hose.</p>

<p>Tests with carpet renovators attached to 100 ft. hose lines in
number equal to the capacity of the plant, and a vacuum of
4¹⁄₂ in. of mercury at the renovator will result in an exhaustion
below that necessary to produce efficient cleaning when bare floor
renovators and carpet renovators with shorter hose lines are
used, as is likely to occur in actual practice.</p>

<p>Again, open hose tests require a variable length of hose to
be used in order to obtain the same air quantity with the proper
vacuum at the separator for economical operation.</p>

<p>If 70 cu. ft. of air is desired, as in the case of Class 2 plant
(<a href="#Page179">Chapter XII</a>), the hose lengths should be:</p>

<p>50 ft. 1 in. diameter. 12 in. vacuum at separator.</p>

<p>75 ft. 1¹⁄₄ in. diameter. 9 in. vacuum at separator.</p>

<p>125 ft. 1¹⁄₂ in. diameter. 6 in. vacuum at separator.</p>

<p>Any of these lengths would give satisfactory cleaning with
one carpet renovator in use, together with sufficient bare floor<span class="pagenum" id="Page189">[189]</span>
renovators to equal the capacity of the plant. This is a possible
condition in any plant.</p>

<p>Another method of testing is to measure the actual air passing
through a given length of hose and require sufficient vacuum
at the separator to produce this flow. This method is open to
the objection that variation in the size of the hose will result in
considerable variation in the vacuum at the separator and conditions
of hose lengths may be such that when carpet renovators
are attached to the hose, the vacuum at the renovator
will vary according to the resistance offered to the passage of
the air by the friction in the hose. With the small hose, the
friction will be greatest, and the reduction in the quantity of
air passing the renovator from that passing an open hose will
result in the greatest reduction in friction loss through the hose
and produce the highest vacuum at the renovator. This will
cause a widely different vacuum at the renovator with different
sizes of hose, each of which passes the same amount of air with
the end of hose open.</p>

<p>What is desired in cleaning operations is a certain degree of
vacuum at the carpet renovator, with the system operated under
the same conditions that will obtain in practical cleaning, and
with cleaners of various types attached to hose ends equal in
number to the capacity of the plant.</p>

<p>The most rational system of testing is one in which the actual
conditions of air quantity and vacuum are measured at the hose
ends. This can be obtained by actually attaching cleaning
tools to the hose ends and measuring the vacuum within the
renovator. However, a wide variation in vacuum will result
when the renovator is moved along the carpet, and this variation
will be different with different operators and different grades
of carpet to such an extent as to render it impossible to actually
meet any requirements that may be specified, unless a considerable
variation in vacuum is permitted.</p>

<p>It is also possible for an operator to become so expert in the
manipulation of the renovators as to be able to meet the specification
requirements with a plant which will not give satisfactory
results in actual operation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page190">[190]</span></p>

<p>The most satisfactory method of testing that has been devised
is the use of an orifice of proper size fixed to the hose end and
measure the vacuum just inside of this orifice. In making
such measurements care must be taken that the tube connecting
to the vacuum gauge is not inserted in such a manner that the
air velocity affects the reading of the vacuum gauge. The
shape of orifice must also be carefully specified, as the rounding
of the edges of the opening will greatly increase the quantity
of air passing a given-sized orifice. The best standard
is a sharp-edged orifice in a thin disk which has a coefficient
of ingress of approximately 65%.</p>

</div><!--container-->

<p>A convenient form of testing appliance based on the orifice
test is the vacometer, manufactured by the Spencer Turbine
Cleaner Company and shown in <a href="#Fig104">Fig. 104</a>.
This device consists of a spherical aluminum
casting, with a 1-in. diameter hole on the
equatorial circle, a vacuum gauge being attached
to one polar extremity, the other being
attached to the end of the hose. A ring having
a slip fit is placed around the equatorial
circle in which openings varying from ¹⁄₂-in.
to ⁷⁄₈-in. diameter are drilled. By turning
this ring any of the orifices may be made to
register with the opening in the sphere. The
opening to which the vacuum gauge is attached
is so located that it is not affected by
the entering air current, and its readings
are not affected by the velocity head.</p>

<p>Experiments with this instrument in connection
with a Pitot tube show that a ¹⁄₂-in.
diameter orifice is equivalent to a Type A
carpet renovator, a ⁵⁄₈-in. orifice to a Type
F renovator and a ⁷⁄₈-in. orifice to a bare floor renovator.</p>

<p>With instruments of this type equal in number to the capacity
of the plant in sweepers, attached to the ends of the
cleaning hose, it is possible to obtain uniform conditions equal
to the average results that will be obtained in actual practice<span class="pagenum" id="Page191">[191]</span>
with renovators attached to the hose, without the possibility
of expert manipulation of the renovators affecting the results.</p>

<p>The proper orifice to be used in each vacometer during the
test will vary with the character of the service for which the
plant is designed, and the author recommends the following
for each of the classes of plants described in <a href="#Page179">Chapter XII</a>:</p>

<p>Class 1. 2-in. mercury, with ¹⁄₂-in. orifice, maximum length
of hose to be used in actual cleaning.</p>

<p>Class 2. One-half the inlets ¹⁄₂-in. orifice, 4.5 in. mercury at
one orifice attached at end of longest hose desired to use in
practice, the remaining ¹⁄₂-in. outlets on shorter hose lengths.
The other half of inlets to have ⁷⁄₈-in. orifices open at same
time, with longest hose on one-quarter of total inlets and shortest
on the balance.</p>

<p>Class 3. All inlets on long hose, one-half with ¹⁄₂-in. orifice,
balance with ⁷⁄₈-in.</p>

<p>Class 4. All inlets to have ⁷⁄₈-in. orifice and 1 in. vacuum at
vacometer, all hose lines maximum length.</p>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>Before the engineer begins to prepare his specifications for
a proposed vacuum cleaning system, he will naturally consider
carefully the conditions to be met in the particular installation
contemplated. Having considered these conditions, he can
readily determine the type of system that will operate most
efficiently and economically under such conditions. It is, therefore,
natural to assume that the best interests of his clients
can be obtained by confining his specifications to apparatus of
the type giving the most efficient results for the special conditions
to be met. However, it is also necessary to study the apparatus
on the market to determine if there is a sufficient number
of manufacturers producing the particular type of apparatus
specified to insure healthy competition and reasonable bids.</p>

<p>It becomes necessary, therefore, to examine the various
systems offered by the manufacturers in order to determine what
competition can be obtained.</p>

<p>Apparatus for Class 1 or Class 2, if confined to the positive
displacement rotary exhausters of the two-impeller type, can
be obtained from at least seven manufacturers. If the centrifugal
fan is included, at least three other manufacturers can
be considered and in either case a healthy competition be had.</p>

<p>If apparatus of Class 3 is desired, it can be obtained from
at least three manufacturers. A few years ago more manufacturers
of systems of this type were in the market. Some
of these have dropped out, owing to the comparatively limited
field for this apparatus. However, there are still enough manufacturers
in the field to insure competition.</p>

<p>Apparatus of Class 4 has been especially manufactured by
one company. However, any of the manufacturers of centrifugal<span class="pagenum" id="Page193">[193]</span>
fan type of apparatus can easily meet the specification
requirements for apparatus of the character.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, evident that the specification of apparatus of
the type best suited to any particular installation will not
result in lack of competition, and such a procedure would apparently
be justified.</p>

<p>There are installations, such as those for public buildings,
where it may be advisable from an administrative standpoint
to allow the widest competition possible. In such cases the engineer
can secure the best results for his clients by so drawing his
specifications as to include all types of apparatus, fixing carefully
the test requirements to be met and requiring each bidder
to state in his proposal the amount of power required to operate
his apparatus under full load, three-quarter load and half-load
conditions, and to base the award of the contract on an evaluation
basis.</p>

<p>To determine what the basis of this evaluation shall be it is
first necessary to ascertain the length of time the plant will be
operated at each of the loads specified and find the annual
cost of a unit of power to operate the plant. Assuming the
plant has a life of ten years, we can charge 10% depreciation,
add to this 5% for interest on the investment and 1% for insurance.
We can capitalize the saving in power at 16% and use
this amount as a basis for evaluation.</p>

<p>As an example, assume one bidder guarantees a power consumption
of 1 K. W. less at full load, 1.25 K. W. less at three-quarters
load and 0.75 K. W. more at half load than a lower
bidder. Assume the plant will operate 500 hrs. per year at full
load, 200 hrs. at three-quarters load and 300 hrs. at half load.
The total kilowatt hours saved by the more economical plant
will be:</p>

<table class="kwhs">

<tr>
<td class="text">Full load 500 × 1 =</td>
<td class="numbers">500</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="text">Three-quarter load 200 × 1.25 =</td>
<td class="numbers bb">250</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="text"><span class="padl4">Total saving</span></td>
<td class="numbers">750</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="text">One-half load, 300 × 0.75 =</td>
<td class="numbers bb">225</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="text"><span class="padl4">Net saving (K. W. Hr.)</span></td>
<td class="numbers">525</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page194">[194]</span></p>

<p>If power costs 5 cents per K. W. Hr. the yearly saving will
be $26.25, which, capitalized at 16%, will equal $164.00. This
is the amount which the owner would be justified in paying for
the more economical plant above the price asked for the
cheaper, but less economical, system.</p>

<p>In order to guard against any bidder guaranteeing a lower
power consumption than he can actually show on test, it is
necessary to impose a penalty for failure to meet the guarantee
which is in excess of the increase in price shown to be justified
by the evaluation.</p>

<p>The author recommends that this penalty be made not less
than 150% of the increase in price shown by the evaluation.</p>

<p>Actually, the owner will not lose by the less efficient plant any
more than the amount shown by the evaluation if he junks the
plant at the end of ten years. However, it is more than likely
that he will either use it for a longer time or will be able to
realize something for the plant when it is displaced. The increased
penalty, therefore, is justified, and it is absolutely
necessary to make this penalty greater than the increased value
to prevent the bidder guaranteeing a power consumption lower
than he can show on test.</p>

of each of the four classes of systems described in <a href="#Page179">Chapter

than:</p>

<p>Full load, 14 K. W.; three-quarter load, 12.25 K. W.; one-half
load, 10.5 K. W.</p>

<p>Test Requirement: Paragraph 75 to be considered full load.
To reduce the load to three-quarters, one ⁷⁄₈-in. vacometer opening
to be closed; to produce one-half load, one ¹⁄₂-in. opening
to be closed in addition to the ⁷⁄₈-in. opening.</p>

<p>Bidders are requested to state in proposal the power consumption
required by their apparatus at full, three-quarters
and one-half loads, and in case the guarantees of the various
bidders differ, they will be evaluated as follows for the purpose
of comparison:</p>

<p>For each full K. W. of power consumption or fractional part
thereof there will be allowed the following amount or proportionate
parts for fractional parts of a K. W. hour at the various
loads:</p>

<table class="standard lg dontwrap">

<p>As an illustration, let it be assumed that proposals have been
received offering equipment in accordance with specification
requirements, and the one offering the most economical apparatus
based on guaranteed power consumption names the highest
price for the installation.</p>

<p>To determine if the purchaser will be justified in accepting
the highest proposal, let it be assumed that he has guaranteed
a power consumption of 1 K. W. less at full load, 0.75 K. W.
less at three-quarters load, and 0.25 K. W. more at half-load
than the lowest bidder. Under these conditions the algebraic
sum of the saving of the higher bidder over the lower bidder
would be 156 + 46.50 - 23.50 = 179, which is the additional
amount in dollars which the purchaser would be warranted in
paying for the apparatus of higher efficiency.</p>

<p>In making the economy test to determine if the guaranteed
power consumption has been fulfilled, an integrating watt
meter, previously calibrated and found correct, will be placed
in circuit and a two-hour run made at each load and the power
consumption based on the meter readings.</p>

<h3 class="inline"><b>Penalty.</b></h3>

<p>In event that the plant is to be run with vacuum “on tap,”

be required and evaluated on the number of hours the plant
will probably operate under these conditions. This will be the

<span class="smcap">Portable Vacuum Cleaners.</span></h2>

</div><!--chapter-->

<p>While this book is primarily intended to deal only with
vacuum cleaning systems, which would limit the work to such
apparatus as is permanently installed within the building to be
cleaned, the author considers that it would not be complete
without some mention of the portable cleaners which are so
popular at the present time.</p>

<p>On first consideration, the portable cleaner would appear to
have a considerable advantage over the stationary type in that
the length of hose is usually limited to not over 15 ft. and
there is no pipe line, which results in the elimination of
practically all friction loss, giving practically the same vacuum
at the renovator as at the exhauster. This should result in a
saving of practically 50% of the power required to operate the
exhauster.</p>

<p>Referring to <a href="#Page179">Chapter XII</a>, we find that the power required
to operate a really efficient vacuum cleaning system is approximately
2.5 H. P. per sweeper. If a portable cleaner, with the
same efficiency and capacity, be built, it would require at least
1¹⁄₂ H. P.</p>

<p>Such a cleaner would not be portable in the sense of the
term as applied to the most popular cleaners today. The same
type has been built on special order by the American Radiator
Company, which mounted its 1¹⁄₂ H. P. Arco Wand machine
on a truck. This cleaner weighs several hundred pounds and
could be moved up and down stairs about as easily as a sewing
machine and would not be of any service in a building not
equipped with elevators. The power required to operate this
cleaner is also so great that special power wiring and large
capacity outlet plugs have to be installed throughout the building.
Such equipment has been provided in at least two department
stores where these cleaners are in use. This means that<span class="pagenum" id="Page229">[229]</span>
one wires his building for vacuum cleaning instead of piping
it, and there is also the necessity of moving a heavy machine
about to do the same work as a stationary plant.</p>

<p>It would appear to the author that the cost of wiring would
about equal that of piping and that the additional labor required
to move the machine about would cost as much as the
additional power needed by the stationary exhauster.</p>

<p>This cleaner, as well as all other portable cleaners, discharges
the air from the exhauster directly back into the apartment
cleaned, and is open to the same objection that was raised
against the early compressed air cleaners. While all the dust
may be caught by the dust bag, the microbes are allowed to
escape with the air and the cleaner is not a sanitary device
by any manner of means.</p>

<p>There are a few portable machines using rotary exhausters
of the Root type, and piston pumps, all of which are heavy to
move about and, in making them as light as possible, the
efficiency of the exhauster has been sacrificed. These machines
will do the same quality of cleaning as the stationary plants
recommended for residence work and they require about ³⁄₄
H. P., which is no less than is needed for a stationary plant
of the same capacity and efficiency.</p>

<p>The most popular type of portable cleaner is one which can
be attached to a socket or plug connected with the lighting
system. This should limit the power consumption to ¹⁄₈ H. P.
However, many of these cleaners use as much as 400 watts
and a fair average for cleaners retailing at about $125.00 is
250 watts. Such cleaners will exhaust about 25 cu. ft. of air
with a vacuum of 1 in. mercury at the vacometer, a ⁵⁄₈-in.
orifice being used. The theoretical power required to move the
air is approximately 50 watts and the overall efficiency of these
cleaners is, therefore, about 20%, as against 40% to 50% in
a good, one-sweeper stationary plant. The power expended in
operating these portable cleaners in proportion to the work
done is no less than with an efficient stationary plant.</p>

<p>Portable cleaners have been made in many types but practically
all the standard makes use one or two forms of vacuum
producers, either the diaphragm pump or the single or multi-stage<span class="pagenum" id="Page230">[230]</span>
fan. The pumps of the former type are able to produce
a vacuum as high as 6 in. to 10 in. of mercury, when no air is
passing, and will displace as high as 30 cu. ft. of free air per
minute, when operated with a free inlet. They produce about
1 in. of mercury at the carpet renovator when operated on an
ordinary carpet. When small-sized upholstery renovators are
used, a much higher vacuum is possible. When operated with
bare floor renovators or brushes, the quantity of air exhausted
is not much over 20 cu. ft. per minute and they make very inefficient
bare floor and wall cleaners, but will do thorough carpet
and upholstery cleaning provided a small enough renovator is
used.</p>

<p>Machines using a multi-stage fan will produce a maximum
vacuum of approximately 2 in. of mercury when exhausting no
air, and will produce a vacuum of approximately 1 in. of mercury
when operated on an ordinary carpet. With an unrestricted
inlet, they will exhaust from 40 to 50 cu. ft. of air per minute.
When operated on a bare floor, they will exhaust approximately
30 cu. ft. of free air per minute. They are, therefore,
more efficient floor cleaners than the pumps, but cannot do
thorough carpet and upholstery cleaning, no matter how small
the renovator.</p>

<p>The smaller-fan type of machines, in which the fan is placed
integral with the carpet renovator and in which hose is not
used in cleaning floors or carpets, are provided with a single-stage
fan. They produce a suction of not exceeding ¹⁄₂ in. of
mercury when no air is exhausted and will exhaust from 5 to
10 cu. ft. of free air per minute when operated on a carpet.
With a free inlet they will exhaust from 15 to 20 cu. ft. of
free air per minute. These machines are little if any better
than ordinary carpet sweepers.</p>

<p>Machines of this type are open to another objection in that
the dust bag is placed on the outlet of the fan and the dust in
the bag is continually agitated by the passage of the air, with
the result that all the finer particles of the dust are blown
through the bag back into the apartment. To be effective, the
dust bag must always be placed on the suction side of the exhauster
and should be so arranged that the dust will not quickly<span class="pagenum" id="Page231">[231]</span>
cover the entire area of the bag, for, when this occurs, the suction
is quickly reduced to such an extent that no further cleaning
can be done until the bag has been cleaned.</p>

<p>There is another type of mechanical cleaner manufactured
by the Hoover Suction Sweeper Company which is provided
with a mechanically-operated brush for loosening the dirt from
the carpet. The dust is then conveyed through a single-stage
fan to a dust bag. The cleaner does not depend on the vacuum
to loosen the dirt and will do quite effective carpet cleaning with
a small expenditure of power. Owing to the small suction
produced, it is of little value for cleaning anything but carpets.</p>

<p>From the experience the author has had with portable vacuum
cleaners, some thirty makes having been tested for the Treasury
Department by him and by the Bureau of Standards, the use
of such cleaners is not considered as either an efficient or sanitary
means of mechanical cleaning.</p>

<p>If a cleaner requiring small power is required, one of the
smaller stationary plants, costing not over $300.00 and operating
with ¹⁄₂ or ³⁄₄ H. P., is considered a better investment than
$125.00 paid for a portable cleaner.</p>

<p>If the purchaser feels that he cannot afford to pay more than
$125.00 for his vacuum cleaner, a type such as the Water Witch
can be furnished for this price. This cleaner is placed in the
basement, with arrangements for starting same from any floor.
The manufacturers state that this apparatus produces a vacuum
of 2 in. mercury in a carpet renovator, 4 in. mercury in an
upholstery renovator and exhausts 25 to 30 cu. ft. of free air
per minute with open hose. The machine operates by water
pressure and the manufacturers state that it requires about 6
to 8 gals. of water per minute. All air is exhausted outside of
the building and all dust washed down the sewer with the exhaust
water. It is therefore, a fairly efficient and sanitary
cleaning system.</p>

<p>The statements made above apply to parties who own their
residences and occupy offices in modern buildings. There are,
besides these, a great many who live in rented houses and
apartments or occupy offices in buildings where the owners are
not sufficiently progressive to install stationary cleaning plants.<span class="pagenum" id="Page232">[232]</span>
To supply the needs of this class is evidently the field of the
portable cleaner, as even the poorest of these machines is more
effective in the removal of dust and dirt than the broom and
carpet sweeper.</p>

<p>The selection of a portable cleaner by one who must necessarily
resort to the use of such a cleaner should be made with
care. The motor should be looked into and only one which has
brushes readily removable and one in which the condition of
the brushes can be easily noted should be selected. Lubrication
is important. A good cleaner should be so constructed that it
can be operated for at least 100 hours without relubrication.</p>

<p>The dust bag should always be on the suction side of the
vacuum producer and of such a design and construction that
at least ¹⁄₂ peck of a mixture of 40% sand, 30% flour,
15% sweepings and 15% Portland cement can be picked up
from the floor and retained in the bag and the machine still be
capable of picking up material from a bare floor.</p>

<p>A good test for capacity of a portable machine is to pick up
¹⁄₂ peck of such material, then fit a thin disk with ⁷⁄₈-in.
diameter opening over the end of the hose. A machine, to be
of any value, should show a suction of 3 in. water and a first-class
machine will show 8 in. under these conditions. This will
do fairly good bare floor work. To ascertain if the machine
will clean carpets, use a similar disk with ⁵⁄₈-in. diameter opening,
when a suction of 7 in. water indicates the lowest value
and 16 in. about the best that can be obtained from any portable
cleaner. Cleaners must be readily portable and should
not weigh exceeding 75 lbs.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
